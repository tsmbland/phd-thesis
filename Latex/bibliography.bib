abstract = {Orthogonal Distance Regresson (ODR) is the name given to the com- putational problem associated with finding the maximum likelihood esti- mators of parameters in measurement error models in the case of normally distributed errors. We examine the stable and efficient algorithm of Boggs, Byrd and Schnabel (SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comput., 8 (1987), pp. 1052– 1078) for finding the solution of this problem when the underlying model is assumed to be nonlinear in both the independent variable and the pa- rameters. We also describe the associated public domain software package, ODRPACK.We then review the results of a simulation study that compares ODR with ordinary least squares (OLS). We also present the new results of an extension to this study. Finally we discuss the use of the asymptotic covariance matrix for computing confidence regions and intervals for the es- timated parameters. Our conclusions are that ODR is better than OLS for the criteria considered, and that ODRPACK can provide effective solutions and useful statistical information for nonlinear ODR problems.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells use conserved multisubunit membrane tethering complexes, including CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering) and HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting), to control the fusion of endomembranes. These complexes have been extensively studied in yeast, but to date there have been far fewer studies of meta-zoan CORVET and HOPS. Both of these complexes comprise six subunits: a common four-subunit core and two unique subunits. Once assembled, these complexes function to recognise specific endosomal membrane markers and facilitate SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. CORVET promotes the homotypic fusion of early endosomes, while HOPS promotes the fusion of lysosomes to late endosomes and autophagosomes. Many of the subunits of both CORVET and HOPS contain putative C-terminal zinc-finger domains. Here, the contribution of these domains to the assembly of the human CORVET and HOPS complexes has been examined. Using biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that the zinc-containing RING (really interesting new gene) domains of human VPS18 and VPS41 interact directly to form a stable heterodimer. In cells, these RING domains are able to integrate into endogenous HOPS, showing that the VPS18 RING domain is required to recruit VPS41 to the core complex subunits. Importantly, this mechanism is not conserved throughout eukaryotes, as yeast Vps41 does not contain a C-terminal zinc-finger motif. The subunit analogous to VPS41 in human CORVET is VPS8, in which the RING domain has an additional C-terminal segment that is predicted to be disordered. Both the RING and disordered C-terminal domains are required for integration of VPS8 into endogenous CORVET complexes, suggesting that HOPS and CORVET recruit VPS41 and VPS8 via distinct molecular interactions.},

Robustness facilitates evolvability and robust traits are often selected by evolution. Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

Studying the P granules of Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that condensate dynamics are regulated by protein clusters that adsorb to the condensate interface. Using in vitro reconstitution, live observations, and theory, we demonstrate that localized assembly of P granules is controlled by MEG-3, an intrinsically disordered protein that forms low dynamic assemblies on P granules. Following classic Pickering emulsion theory, MEG-3 clusters lower surface tension and slow down coarsening. During zygote polarization, MEG-3 recruits the DYRK family kinase MBK-2 to accelerate spatially regulated growth of the P granule emulsion. By tuning condensate-cytoplasm exchange, interfacial clusters regulate the structural integrity of biomolecular condensates, reminiscent of the role of lipid bilayers in membrane-bound organelles.},

abstract = {Chemical gradients can generate pattern formation in biological systems. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a cortical gradient of pom1p (a DYRK-type protein kinase) functions to position sites of cytokinesis and cell polarity and to control cell length. Here, using quantitative imaging, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and mathematical modeling, we study how its gradient distribution is formed. Pom1p gradients exhibit large cell-to-cell variability, as well as dynamic fluctuations in each individual gradient. Our data lead to a two-state model for gradient formation in which pom1p molecules associate with the plasma membrane at cell tips and then diffuse on the membrane while aggregating into and fragmenting from clusters, before disassociating from the membrane. In contrast to a classical one-component gradient, this two-state gradient buffers against cell-to-cell variations in protein concentration. This buffering mechanism, together with time averaging to reduce intrinsic noise, allows the pom1p gradient to specify positional information in a robust manner. In fission yeast, a pom1p kinase cortical gradient regulates cell size, cell polarity, and cytokinesis. Saunders et al. use quantitative imaging, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and mathematical modeling to propose a two-state model of gradient formation involving pom1p clustering that, together with intrinsic noise reduction via time averaging, ensures robust pom1p function. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Epithelial cells grow to characteristic densities, often from proliferative progenitors, which arrest as they mature. Homeostatic mechanisms can maintain this characteristic density if it is exceeded (crowding) or is too low (e.g. in response to wounding). During tumor initiation and progression this homeostatic mechanism is lost. Some aspects of cell polarity are also lost, although many carcinomas retain intercellular junctions and even apical domains. In other cases, and particularly in recurrent tumors, however, the cells become predominantly mesenchymal. A major question, still only incompletely answered, is whether the proteins that determine cell polarity function as tumor suppressors or tumor promoters. Here we discuss recent advances in understanding the role of polarity proteins and homeostasis in cancer.},

These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use.

abstract = {The lipid-anchored small GTPase Ras is an important signaling node in mammalian cells. A number of observations suggest that Ras is laterally organized within the cell membrane, and this may play a regulatory role in its activation. Lipid anchors composed of palmitoyl and farnesyl moieties in H-, N-, and K-Ras are widely suspected to be responsible for guiding protein organization in membranes. Here,we report that H-Ras forms a dimer on membrane surfaces through a protein-protein binding interface. A Y64A point mutation in the switch II region, known to prevent Son of sevenless and PI3K effector interactions, abolishes dimer formation. This suggests that the switch II region, near the nucleotide binding cleft, is either part of, or allosterically coupled to, the dimer interface. By tethering H-Ras to bilayers via a membrane-miscible lipid tail, we show that dimer formation is mediated by protein interactions and does not require lipid anchor clustering. We quantitatively characterize H-Ras dimerization in supported membranes using a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, photon counting histogram analysis, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, single-molecule tracking, and step photobleaching analysis. The 2D dimerization Kd is measured to be ∼1 × 103 molecules/$\mu$m2, and no higher-order oligomers were observed. Dimerization only occurs on the membrane surface; H-Ras is strictly monomeric at comparable densities in solution. Analysis of a number of H-Ras constructs, including key changes to the lipidation pattern of the hypervariable region, suggest that dimerization is a general property of native H-Ras on membrane surfaces.},

Most TRIM family members bind ubiquitin E2s and many acquire ligase activity upon RING dimerization. In contrast, PML binds UBC9, the SUMO E2 enzyme. Here, using X-ray crystallography and SAXS characterization, we demonstrate that PML RING tetramerizes through highly conserved PML-specific sequences, which are required for NB assembly and PML sumoylation. Conserved residues implicated in RING dimerization of other TRIMs also contribute to PML tetramer stability. Wild-Type PML rescues the ability of some RING mutants to form NBs as well as their sumoylation. Impaired RING tetramerization abolishes PML/RARA-driven leukemogenesis in vivo and arsenic-induced differentiation ex vivo. Our studies thus identify RING tetramerization as a key step in the NB macro-molecular scaffolding. They suggest that higher order RING interactions allow efficient UBC9 recruitment and thus change the biochemical nature of TRIM-facilitated post-Translational modifications.},

abstract = {Cell polarization is a prerequisite for essential processes such as cell migration, proliferation or differentiation. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under control of the GTPase Cdc42 is able to polarize without the help of cytoskeletal structures and spatial cues through a pathway depending on its guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) Rdi1. To develop a fundamental understanding of yeast polarization we establish a detailed mechanistic model of GDI-mediated polarization. We show that GDI-mediated polarization provides precise spatial and temporal control of Cdc42 signaling and give experimental evidence for our findings. Cell cycle induced changes of Cdc42 regulation enhance positive feedback loops of active Cdc42 production, and thereby allow simultaneous switch-like regulation of focused polarity and Cdc42 activation. This regulation drives the direct formation of a unique polarity cluster with characteristic narrowing dynamics, as opposed to the previously proposed competition between transient clusters. As the key components of the studied system are conserved among eukaryotes, we expect our findings also to apply to cell polarization in other organisms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kl{\"{u}}nder et al.},

We review models based on anticorrelated displacements, such as fractional Brownian motion and obstructed diffusion, and nonstationary models such as continuous time random walks.

Foraging theory predicts that in environments with sparsely distributed target resources, where forager knowledge about resources' locations is incomplete, L{\'{e}}vy flight movements optimize the success of random searches. However, the putative success of L{\'{e}}vy foraging has been demonstrated only in model simulations. Here, we use high-temporal-resolution Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking of wandering (Diomedea exulans) and black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophrys) with simultaneous recording of prey captures, to show that both species exhibit L{\'{e}}vy and Brownian movement patterns. We find that total prey masses captured by wandering albatrosses during L{\'{e}}vy movements exceed daily energy requirements by nearly four-fold, and approached yields by Brownian movements in other habitats. These results, together with our reanalysis of previously published albatross data, overturn the notion that albatrosses do not exhibit L{\'{e}}vy patterns during foraging, and demonstrate that L{\'{e}}vy flights of predators in dynamic natural environments present a beneficial alternative strategy to simple, spatially intensive behaviors. Our findings add support to the possibility that biological L{\'{e}}vy flight may have naturally evolved as a search strategy in response to sparse resources and scant information.},

@article{Meinhardt1974,
abstract = {Model calculations are presented for various problems of development on the basis of a theory of primary pattern formation which were previously proposed. The theory involves short range autocatalytic activation and longer range inhibition (lateral inhibition). When a certain criterion is satisfied, self regulating patterns are generated. The autocatalytic features of the theory are demonstrated by simulations of the determination of polarity in the Xenopus retina. General conditions for marginal and internal activation, and corresponding effects of symmetry are discussed. Special molecular mechanisms of pattern formation are proposed in which activator is chemically converted into inhibitor, or an activator precursor is depleted by conversion into activator. The (slow) effects of primary patterns on differentiation can be included into the formalism in a straightforward manner. In conjunction with growth, this can lead to asymmetric steady states of cell types, cell differentiation and proliferation as found, for instance, in growing and budding hydra. In 2 dimensions, 2 different types of patterns can be obtained. Under some assumptions, a single pattern forming system produces a 'bristle' type pattern of peaks of activity with rather regular spacings on a surface. Budding of hydra is treated on this basis. If, however, gradients develop under the influence of a weak external or marginal assymetry, a monotonic gradient can be formed across the entire field, and 2 such gradient forming systems can specify 'positional information' in 2 dimensions. If inhibitor equilibrates slowly, a spatial pattern may oscillate, as observed with regard to the intracellular activation of cellular slime moulds. The applications are intended to demonstrate the ability of the proposed theory to explain properties frequently encountered in developing systems.},

PAR-1 activity is believed to be transduced by binding of 14-3-3 proteins to its phosphorylated substrates, but the relevant targets are unknown. We show that PAR-1 phosphorylates Bazooka/PAR-3 on two conserved serines to generate 14-3-3 binding sites. This inhibits formation of the Bazooka/PAR-6/aPKC complex by blocking Bazooka oligomerization and binding to aPKC. In epithelia, this complex localizes apically and defines the apical membrane, whereas Bazooka lacking PAR-1 phosphorylation/14-3-3 binding sites forms ectopic lateral complexes. Lateral exclusion by PAR-1/14-3-3 cooperates with apical anchoring by Crumbs/Stardust to restrict Bazooka localization, and loss of both pathways disrupts epithelial polarity. PAR-1 also excludes Bazooka from the posterior of the oocyte, and disruption of this regulation causes anterior-posterior polarity defects. Thus, antagonism of Bazooka by PAR-1/14-3-3 may represent a general mechanism for establishing complementary cortical domains in polarized cells.},

In such asymmetric divisions, the mitotic spindle must be asymmetrically positioned at the end of anaphase2,3. The mechanisms by which cell polarity translates to asymmetric spindle positioning remain unclear. Here we examine the nature of the forces governing asymmetric spindle positioning in the single-cell-stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. To reveal the forces that act on each spindle pole, we removed the central spindle in living embryos either physically with an ultraviolet laser microbeam, or genetically by RNA-mediated interference of a kinesin4. We show that pulling forces external to the spindle act on the two spindle poles. A stronger net force acts on the posterior pole, thereby explaining the overall posterior displacement seen in wild-type embryos. We also show that the net force acting on each spindle pole is under control of the par genes that are required for cell polarity along the anterior-posterior embryonic axis. Finally, we discuss simple mathematical models that describe the main features of spindle pole behaviour. Our work suggests a mechanism for generating asymmetry in spindle positioning by varying the net pulling force that acts on each spindle pole, thus allowing for the generation of daughter cells with different sizes.},

abstract = {The position of the mitotic spindle controls the plane of cell cleavage and determines whether polarized cells divide symmetrically or asymmetrically. In animals, an evolutionarily conserved pathway of LIN-5 (homologues: Mud and NuMA), GPR-1/2 (homologues: Pins, LGN, AGS-3) and G$\alpha$ mediates spindle positioning, and acts downstream of the conserved PAR-3-PAR-6-aPKC polarity complex. However, molecular interactions between polarity proteins and LIN-5-GPR-G$\alpha$ remain to be identified. Here we describe a quantitative mass spectrometry approach for in vivo identification of protein kinase substrates. Applying this strategy to Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, we found that depletion of the polarity kinase PKC-3 results in markedly decreased levels of phosphorylation of a cluster of four LIN-5 serine residues. These residues are directly phosphorylated by PKC-3 in vitro. Phospho-LIN-5 co-localizes with PKC-3 at the anterior cell cortex and temporally coincides with a switch from anterior-to posterior-directed spindle movements in the one-cell embryo. LIN-5 mutations that prevent phosphorylation increase the extent of anterior-directed spindle movements, whereas phosphomimetic mutations decrease spindle migration. Our results indicate that anterior-located PKC-3 inhibits cortical microtubule pulling forces through direct phosphorylation of LIN-5. This molecular interaction between polarity and spindle-positioning proteins may be used broadly in cell cleavage plane determination. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Here we show how protein concentration gradients can theoretically be sustained indefinitely through a relatively simple mechanism that couples diffusion to a spatially segregated kinase-phosphatase system. Although it is appreciated that such systems can theoretically give rise to phosphostate gradients, it has been assumed that they do not give rise to gradients in the total protein concentration. Here we show that this assumption does not hold if the two forms of protein have different diffusion coefficients. If, for example, the phosphorylated state binds selectively to a second larger protein or protein complex then a steady state gradient in total protein concentration will be created. We illustrate the principle with an analytical solution to the diffusion-reaction problem and by stochastic individual-based simulations using the Smoldyn program. We argue that protein gradients created in this way need to be considered in experiments using fluorescent probes and could in principle encode spatial information in the cytoplasm.},

Strong mutations insupernumerary limbs(slmb), which encodes the substrate adaptor of an SCF-class E3 ubiquitin ligase, cause dramatic loss of polarity in imaginal discs accompanied by tumorous proliferation defects. Slmb function is required to restrain apical aPKC activity in a manner that is independent of endolysosomal trafficking and parallel to the Scribble module of junctional scaffolding proteins.

abstract = {The Drosophilaanterior-posterior axis is specified when the posterior follicle cells signal to polarise the oocyte, leading to the anterior/lateral localisation of the Par-6/aPKC complex and the posterior recruitment of Par-1, which induces a microtubule reorganisation that localises bicoidandoskar mRNAs. Here we show that oocyte polarity requires Slmb, the substrate specificity subunit of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets proteins for degradation. The Par-6/aPKC complex is ectopically localised to the posterior ofslmbmutant oocytes, and Par-1 andoskar mRNA are mislocalised. Slmb appears to play a related role in epithelial follicle cells, as large slmbmutant clones disrupt epithelial organisation, whereas small clones show an expansion of the apical domain, with increased accumulation of apical polarity factors at the apical cortex. The levels of aPKC and Par-6 are significantly increased in slmb mutants, whereas Baz is slightly reduced. Thus, Slmb may induce the polarisation of the anteriorposterior axis of the oocyte by targeting the Par-6/aPKC complex for degradation at the oocyte posterior. Consistent with this, overexpression of the aPKC antagonist Lgl strongly rescues the polarity defects ofslmbmutant germline clones. The role of Slmb in oocyte polarity raises an intriguing parallel withC. elegansaxis formation, in which PAR-2 excludes the anterior PAR complex from the posterior cortex to induce polarity, but its function can be substituted by overexpressing Lgl. {\textcopyright} 2014.

We describe a complex that targets the Protein Phosphatase 2A holoenzyme (PP2A) to centrosomes in C. elegans embryos. This complex includes Regulator of Spindle Assembly 1 (RSA-1), a targeting subunit for PP2A, and RSA-2, a protein that binds and recruits RSA-1 to centrosomes. In contrast to the multiple functions of the PP2A catalytic subunit, RSA-1 and RSA-2 are specifically required for microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes and for spindle assembly. The centrosomally localized RSA-PP2A complex mediates these functions in part by regulating two critical mitotic effectors: the microtubule destabilizer KLP-7 and the C. elegans regulator of spindle assembly TPXL-1. By regulating a subset of PP2A functions at the centrosome, the RSA complex could therefore provide a means of coordinating microtubule outgrowth from centrosomes and kinetochore microtubule stability during mitotic spindle assembly. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Polarity establishment requires a symmetry–breaking event, resulting in an axis along which determinants are segregated. In Caenorhabditis elegans, oocytes are apolar and are triggered to polarize rapidly along one axis after fertilization. The establishment of this first polarity axis is revealed by the asymmetric distribution of PAR proteins and cortical activity in the one–celled embryo. Current evidence suggests that the centrosome–pronucleus complex contributed by the sperm is involved in defining the polarization axis. Here we directly assess the contribution of the centrosome to polarity establishment by laser ablating the centrosome before and during polarization. We find that the centrosome is required to initiate polarity but not to maintain it. Initiation of polarity coincides with the proximity of the centrosome to the cortex and the assembly of pericentriolar material on the immature sperm centrosome. Depletion of microtubules or the microtubule nucleator ±–tubulin did not affect polarity establishment. These results demonstrate that the centrosome provides an initiating signal that polarizes C. elegans embryos and indicate that this signalling event might be independent of the role of the centrosome as a microtubule nucleator. {\textcopyright} 2004 Nature publishing group.},

abstract = {PDZ domains are protein-protein interaction modules that recognize specific C-terminal sequences to assemble protein complexes in multicellular organisms. By scanning billions of random peptides, we accurately map binding specificity for approximately half of the over 330 PDZ domains in the human and Caenorhabditis elegans proteomes. The domains recognize features of the last seven ligand positions, and we find 16 distinct specificity classes conserved from worm to human, significantly extending the canonical two-class system based on position -2. Thus, most PDZ domains are not promiscuous, but rather are fine-tuned for specific interactions. Specificity profiling of 91 point mutants of a model PDZ domain reveals that the binding site is highly robust, as all mutants were able to recognize C-terminal peptides. However, many mutations altered specificity for ligand positions both close and far from the mutated position, suggesting that binding specificity can evolve rapidly under mutational pressure. Our specificity map enables the prediction and prioritization of natural protein interactions, which can be used to guide PDZ domain cell biology experiments. Using this approach, we predicted and validated several viral ligands for the PDZ domains of the SCRIB polarity protein. These findings indicate that many viruses produce PDZ ligands that disrupt host protein complexes for their own benefit, and that highly pathogenic strains target PDZ domains involved in cell polarity and growth. {\textcopyright} 2008 Tonikian et al.},

abstract = {During the initial cleavages of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, a series of rapid and invariant asymmetric cell divisions pattern the fate, size, and position of four somatic blastomeres and a single germline blastomere. These asymmetric divisions are orchestrated by a collection of maternally deposited factors that are initially symmetrically distributed in the newly fertilized embryo. Maturation of the sperm-derived centrosome in the posterior cytoplasm breaks this symmetry by triggering a dramatic and highly stereotyped partitioning of these maternal factors. A network of conserved cell polarity regulators, the PAR proteins, form distinct anterior and posterior domains at the cell cortex. From these domains, the PAR proteins direct the segregation of somatic and germline factors into opposing regions of the cytoplasm such that, upon cell division, they are preferentially inherited by the somatic blastomere or the germline blastomere, respectively. The segregation of these factors is controlled, at least in part, by a series of reaction-diffusion mechanisms that are asymmetrically deployed along the anterior/posterior axis. The characterization of these mechanisms has important implications for our understanding of how cells are polarized and how spatial organization is generated in the cytoplasm.},

abstract = {A hallmark of neurons is their ability to polarize with dendrite and axon specification to allow the proper flow of information through the nervous system. Over the past decade, extensive research has been performed in an attempt to understand the molecular and cellular machinery mediating this neuronal polarization process. It has become evident that many of the critical regulators involved in establishing neuronal polarity are evolutionarily conserved proteins that had previously been implicated in controlling the polarization of other cell types. At the forefront of this research are the partition defective (Par) proteins. In this review,we will provide a commentary on the progressof work regarding the central importance of Parproteins in the establishment of neuronal polarity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Par-3, the central organizer of the Par-3/Par-6/atypical protein kinase C complex, is a multimodular scaffold protein that is essential for cell polarity establishment and maintenance. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of Par-3 is capable of self-association to form filament-like structures, although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we determined the crystal structure of Par-3 NTD and solved the filament structure by cryoelectron microscopy. We found that an intrinsic "front-to-back" interaction mode is important for Par-3 NTD self-association and that both the lateral and longitudinal packing within the filament are mediated by electrostatic interactions. Disruptions of the lateral or longitudinal packing significantly impaired Par-3 NTD self-association and thereby impacted the Par-3-mediated epithelial polarization. We finally demonstrated that a Par-3 NTD-like domain from histidine ammonia-lyase also harbors a similar self-association capacity. This work unequivocally provides the structural basis for Par-3 NTD self-association and characterizes one type of protein domain that can self-assemble via electrostatic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cdc42 protein, a member of the Ras superfamily of low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins, is involved in the control of cell polarity during the yeast cell cycle. This protein has a consensus sequence (CAAX) for geranylgeranyl modification and is likely to be associated, at least in part, with cell membranes. Using cell fractionation and immunolocalization techniques, we have investigated the subcellular localization of Cdc42p. Cdc42p was found in both soluble and particulate pools, and neither its abundance nor its distribution varied through the cell cycle. The particulate form of Cdc42p could be solubilized with detergents but not with NaCl or urea, suggesting that it is tightly associated with membranes. An increase in soluble Cdc42p was observed in a geranylgeranyltransferase mutant strain (cdc43-2ts) grown at the restrictive temperature. In addition, Cdc42p from a cdc42C188S mutant strain (that has an alteration at the prenylation consensus site) was almost exclusively in the soluble fraction, suggesting that membrane localization is dependent on geranylgeranyl modification at Cys-188. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy experiments demonstrated that Cdc42p localizes to the plasma membrane in the vicinity of secretory vesicles that were found at the site of bud emergence, at the tips and sides of enlarging buds, and within mating projections (shmoo tips) in $\alpha$-factor-arrested cells. These results indicate that Cdc42p is localized to the bud site early in the cell cycle and suggest that this localization is critical for the selection of the proper site for bud emergence and for polarized cell growth.},

abstract = {Asymmetric cell divisions, critically important to specify cell types in the development of multicellular organisms, require polarized distribution of cytoplasmic components and the proper alignment of the mitotic apparatus. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the maternally expressed protein, PAR-3, is localized to one pole of asymmetrically dividing blastomeres and is required for these asymmetric divisions. In this paper, we report that an atypical protein kinase C (PKC-3) is essential for proper asymmetric cell divisions and co-localizes with PAR-3. Embryos depleted of PKC-3 by RNA interference die showing Par-like phenotypes including defects in early asymmetric divisions and mislocalized germline-specific granules (P granules). The defective phenotypes of PKC-3-depleted embryos are similar to those exhibited by mutants for par-3 and another par gene, par-6. Direct interaction of PKC-3 with PAR-3 is shown by in vitro binding analysis. This result is reinforced by the observation that PKC-3 and PAR-3 co-localize in vivo. Furthermore, PKC-3 and PAR-3 show mutual dependence on each other and on three of the other par genes for their localization. We conclude that PKC-3 plays an indispensable role in establishing embryonic polarity through interaction with PAR-3.},

A third gene, pkc-3, gives a similar phenotype when the protein is depleted by RNA interference. PAR-3 and PKC-3 protein are colocalized to the anterior periphery of asymmetrically dividing cells of the germline lineage and the peripheral localizations of both proteins depends upon the activity of par-6. Here we report the molecular cloning of par-6 and the immunolocalization of PAR-6 protein. We found that par-6 encodes a PDZ-domain-containing protein and has homologues in mammals and flies. Moreover, we discovered that PAR-6 colocalizes with PAR-3 and that par-3 and pkc-3 activity are required for the peripheral localization of PAR-6. The localization of both PAR-3 and PAR-6 proteins is affected identically by mutations in the par-2, par-4 and par-5 genes. The co-dependence of PAR-3, PAR-6 and PKC-3 for peripheral localization and the overlap in their distributions lead us to propose that they act in a protein complex.},

Both Par-3 and Par-6 are PDZ domain containing scaffold proteins capable of binding to polarity regulatory proteins. In addition to three PDZ domains, Par-3 also contains a conserved N-terminal oligomerization domain (NTD) that is essential for proper subapical membrane localization and consequently the functions of Par-3. The molecular basis of NTD-mediated Par-3 membrane localization is poorly understood. Here, we describe the structure of a monomeric form of the Par-3 NTD. Unexpectedly, the domain adopts a PB1-like fold with both type-I and type-II structural features. The Par-3 NTD oligomerizes into helical filaments via front-to-back interactions. We further demonstrate that the NTD-mediated membrane localization of Par-3 in MDCK cells is solely attributed to its oligomerization capacity. The data presented in this study suggest that the Par-3 NTD is likely to facilitate the assembly of higher-order Par-3/Par-6/aPKC complex with increased avidities in targeting the complex to the subapical membrane domain and in binding to other polarity-regulating proteins. {\textcopyright}2007 European Molecular Biology Organization.},

The characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory is a challenging task, which traditionally relies on calculating the trajectory mean squared displacement. However, this approach breaks down for cases of practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, heterogeneous behaviour, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. To perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams applied their algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, machine-learning-based approaches achieved superior performance for all tasks. The discussion of the challenge results provides practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers.},

abstract = {In quantitative genetics, the effects of developmental relationships among traits on microevolution are generally represented by the contribution of pleiotropy to additive genetic covariances. Pleiotropic additive genetic covariances arise only from the average effects of alleles on multiple traits, and therefore the evolutionary importance of nonlinearities in development is generally neglected in quantitative genetic views on evolution. However, nonlinearities in relationships among traits at the level of whole organisms are undeniably important to biology in general, and therefore critical to understanding evolution. I outline a system for characterizing key quantitative parameters in nonlinear developmental systems, which yields expressions for quantities such as trait means and phenotypic and genetic covariance matrices. I then develop a system for quantitative prediction of evolution in nonlinear developmental systems. I apply the system to generating a new hypothesis for why direct stabilizing selection is rarely observed. Other uses will include separation of purely correlative from direct and indirect causal effects in studying mechanisms of selection, generation of predictions of medium-term evolutionary trajectories rather than immediate predictions of evolutionary change over single generation time-steps, and the development of efficient and biologically motivated models for separating additive from epistatic genetic variances and covariances.},

abstract = {Canalization, or robustness to genetic or environmental perturbations, is fundamental to complex organisms. While there is strong evidence for canalization as an evolved property that varies among genotypes, the developmental and genetic mechanisms that produce this phenomenon are very poorly understood. For evolutionary biology, understanding how canalization arises is important because, by modulating the phenotypic variation that arises in response to genetic differences, canalization is a determinant of evolvability. For genetics of disease in humans and for economically important traits in agriculture, this subject is important because canalization is a potentially significant cause of missing heritability that confounds genomic prediction of phenotypes. We review the major lines of thought on the developmental-genetic basis for canalization. These fall into two groups. One proposes specific evolved molecular mechanisms while the other deals with robustness or canalization as a more general feature of development. These explanations for canalization are not mutually exclusive and they overlap in several ways. General explanations for canalization are more likely to involve emergent features of development than specific molecular mechanisms. Disentangling these explanations is also complicated by differences in perspectives between genetics and developmental biology. Understanding canalization at a mechanistic level will require conceptual and methodological approaches that integrate quantitative genetics and developmental biology.},

The mechanisms that produce robustness are poorly understood. Nonlinearities are a ubiquitous feature of development that may link variation in development to phenotypic robustness. Here, we manipulate the gene dosage of a signaling molecule, Fgf8, a critical regulator of vertebrate development. We demonstrate that variation in Fgf8 expression has a nonlinear relationship to phenotypic variation, predicting levels of robustness among genotypes. Differences in robustness are not due to gene expression variance or dysregulation, but emerge from the nonlinearity of the genotype-phenotype curve. In this instance, embedded features of development explain robustness differences. How such features vary in natural populations and relate to genetic variation are key questions for unraveling the origin and evolvability of this feature of organismal development.},

Over half gave defects in early processes such as meiosis, the assembly or position of the first mitotic spindle, cytokinesis, and proper nuclear positioning. For some phenotypic classes, the majority of genes are involved in a shared biochemical process. In addition, we identified loss-of-function phenotypes for genes of unknown function, but for which homologues exist in other organisms, shedding light on the function of these uncharacterized genes. When applied to the whole genome, this approach should identify the vast majority of genes required for early cell processes, paving the way for a greatly improved understanding of these processes and their regulation at the molecular level.},

abstract = {Facilitated by recent advances using CRISPR/Cas9, genome editing technologies now permit custom genetic modifications in a wide variety of organisms. Ideally, modified animals could be both efficiently made and easily identified with minimal initial screening and without introducing exogenous sequence at the locus of interest or marker mutations elsewhere. To this end, we describe a coconversion strategy, using CRISPR/Cas9 in which screening for a dominant phenotypic oligonucleotide-templated conversion event at one locus can be used to enrich for custom modifications at another unlinked locus. After the desired mutation is identified among the F1 progeny heterozygous for the dominant marker mutation, F2 animals that have lost the marker mutation are picked to obtain the desired mutation in an unmarked genetic background. We have developed such a coconversion strategy for Caenorhabditis elegans, using a number of dominant phenotypic markers. Examining the coconversion at a second (unselected) locus of interest in the marked F1 animals, we observed that 14-84% of screened animals showed homologous recombination. By reconstituting the unmarked background through segregation of the dominant marker mutation at each step, we show that custom modification events can be carried out recursively, enabling multiple mutant animals to be made. While our initial choice of a coconversion marker [rol-6(su1006)] was readily applicable in a single round of coconversion, the genetic properties of this locus were not optimal in that CRISPR-mediated deletion mutations at the unselected rol-6 locus can render a fraction of coconverted strains recalcitrant to further rounds of similar mutagenesis. An optimal marker in this sense would provide phenotypic distinctions between the desired mutant/+ class and alternative +/+, mutant/null, null/null, and null/+ genotypes. Reviewing dominant alleles from classical C. elegans genetics, we identified one mutation in dpy-10 and one mutation in sqt-1 that meet these criteria and demonstrate that these too can be used as effective conversion markers. Coconversion was observed using a variety of donor molecules at the second (unselected) locus, including oligonucleotides, PCR products, and plasmids. We note that the coconversion approach described here could be applied in any of the variety of systems where suitable coconversion markers can be identified from previous intensive genetic analyses of gain-of-function alleles.},

The purpose of our tool is to allowC. elegans researchers to predict piRNA targeting sites and to avoid the persistent germline silencing of transgenes that has renderedmany constructs unusable. pirScan fulfills this purpose by first enumerating the predicted piRNA-targeting sites present in an input sequence. This prediction can be exported in a tabular or graphical format. Subsequently, pirScan suggests silent mutations that can be introduced to the input sequence that would allow the modified transgene to avoid piRNA targeting. The user can customize the piRNA targeting stringency and the silent mutations that he/she wants to introduce into the sequence. The modified sequences can be re-submitted to be certain that any previously present piRNA-targeting sites are now absent and no new piRNA-targeting sites are accidentally generated. This revised sequence can finally be downloaded as a text file and/or visualized in a graphical format.},

Large-scale targeted-deletions have been successful in defining gene functions in the single-celled yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but comparable analyses have yet to be performed in an animal. Here we describe the use of RNA interference to inhibit the function of ∼86% of the 19,427 predicted genes of C. elegans. We identified mutant phenotypes for 1,722 genes, about two-thirds of which were not previously associated with a phenotype. We find that genes of similar functions are clustered in distinct, multi-megabase regions of individual chromosomes; genes in these regions tend to share transcriptional profiles. Our resulting data set and reusable RNAi library of 16,757 bacterial clones will facilitate systematic analyses of the connections among gene sequence, chromosomal location and gene function in C. elegans.},

abstract = {When expression of more than one gene is required in cells, bicistronic or multicistronic expression vectors have been used. Among various strategies employed to construct bicistronic or multicistronic vectors, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) has been widely used. Due to the large size and difference in expression levels between genes before and after IRES, however, a new strategy was required to replace IRES. A self-cleaving 2A peptide could be a good candidate to replace IRES because of its small size and high cleavage efficiency between genes upstream and downstream ofthe 2A peptide. Despite the advantages of the 2A peptides, its use is not widespread because (i) there are no publicly available cloning vectors harboring a 2A peptide gene and (ii) comprehensive comparison of cleavage efficiency among various 2A peptides reported to date has not been performed in different contexts. Here, we generated four expression plasmids each harboring different 2A peptides derived from the foot-and-mouth disease virus, equine rhinitis A virus, Thoseaasigna virus and porcine teschovirus-1, respectively, and evaluated their cleavage efficiency in three commonly used human cell lines, zebrafish embryos and adult mice. Western blotting and confocal microscopic analyses revealed that among the four 2As, the one derived from porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A) has the highest cleavage efficiency in all the contexts examined. We anticipate that the 2A-harboring cloning vectors we generated and the highest efficiency of the P2A peptide we demonstrated would help biomedical researchers easily adopt the 2A technology when bicistronic or multicistronic expression is required. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kim et al.},

Sedimentation and gel filtration are hydrodynamic techniques that can be used for this medium resolution structural analysis. This review collects a number of simple calculations that are useful for thinking about protein structure at the nanometer level. Readers are reminded that the Perrin equation is generally not a valid approach to determine the shape of proteins. Instead, a simple guideline is presented, based on the measured sedimentation coefficient and a calculated maximum S, to estimate if a protein is globular or elongated. It is recalled that a gel filtration column fractionates proteins on the basis of their Stokes radius, not molecular weight. The molecular weight can be determined by combining gradient sedimentation and gel filtration, techniques available in most biochemistry laboratories, as originally proposed by Siegel and Monte. Finally, rotary shadowing and negative stain electron microscopy are powerful techniques for resolving the size and shape of single protein molecules and complexes at the nanometer level. A combination of hydrodynamics and electron microscopy is especially powerful.},

abstract = {The majority of soluble and membrane-bound proteins in modern cells are symmetrical oligomeric complexes with two or more subunits. The evolutionary selection of symmetrical oligomeric complexes is driven by functional, genetic, and physicochemical needs. Large proteins are selected for specific morphological functions, such as formation of rings, containers, and filaments, and for cooperative functions, such as allosteric regulation and multivalent binding. Large proteins are also more stable against denaturation and have a reduced surface area exposed to solvent when compared with many individual, smaller proteins. Large proteins are constructed as oligomers for reasons of error control in synthesis, coding efficiency, and regulation of assembly. Symmetrical oligomers are favored because of stability and finite control of assembly. Several functions limit symmetry, such as interaction with DNA or membranes, and directional motion. Symmetry is broken or modified in many forms: quasisymmetry, in which identical subunits adopt similar but different conformations; pleomorphism, in which identical subunits form different complexes; pseudosymmetry, in which different molecules form approximately symmetrical complexes; and symmetry mismatch, in which oligomers of different symmetries interact along their respective symmetry axes. Asymmetry is also observed at several levels. Nearly all complexes show local asymmetry at the level of side chain conformation. Several complexes have reciprocating mechanisms in which the complex is asymmetric, but, over time, all subunits cycle through the same set of conformations. Global asymmetry is only rarely observed. Evolution of oligomeric complexes may favor the formation of dimers over complexes with higher cyclic symmetry, through a mechanism of prepositioned pairs of interacting residues. However, examples have been found for all of the crystallographic point groups, demonstrating that functional need can drive the evolution of any symmetry.},

Here we elucidate an inhibitory mechanism of TRIM56 and TRIM65 targeting by SopA. We present the crystal structure of SopA in complex with the RING domain of human TRIM56, revealing the atomic details of their interaction and the basis for SopA selectivity towards TRIM56 and TRIM65. Structure-guided biochemical analysis shows that SopA inhibits TRIM56 E3 ligase activity by occluding the E2-interacting surface of TRIM56. We further demonstrate that SopA ubiquitinates TRIM56 and TRIM65, resulting in their proteasomal degradation during infection. Our results provide the basis for how a bacterial HECT ligase blocks host RING ligases and exemplifies the multivalent power of bacterial effectors during infection.},

abstract = {Most cell types exhibit some form of asymmetry, often termed polarity, creating distinct cell ends with specialised functions. One highly conserved mechanism for initially differentiating cell ends involves proteins of the PAR polarity network, which self-organise into opposing domains on the cortex of cells, generating an initial asymmetry which can act as a landmark for further asymmetries. For proper development and tissue homeostasis of multicellular organisms, polarity must be controlled in time, as many cell types undergo alternating periods of being polarised, and not being polarised. However, how the underlying PAR networks are temporally regulated, in terms of being able to respond to symmetry-breaking cues and polarise, is not well understood. The one-cell embryo of the model organism C. elegans is initially unpolarised, but polarises upon completion of maternal meiosis. This project has identified that the PAR network is initially inactive in immature oocytes, due to members of the anterior PAR complex being unable to associate with the cortex at this time. Oocyte maturation - independent of fertilisation or meiosis completion - was identified as the key process in activating the PAR network, by allowing anterior PARs to localise to the cortex, and localising posterior PARs to the cytoplasm. This renders the network capable of polarising the cortex in response to symmetry-breaking cues. Furthermore, anterior PAR cortical localisation is negatively regulated by the cell cycle regulators AuroraA and Polo-like kinase in oocytes, thus linking the activation of the PAR network to cell cycle progression, thereby enabling the proper coordination of PAR network activation and cue maturation, ensuring singularity of PAR domain formation.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Biological systems are increasingly viewed through the lens of mathematics, physics, and systems approaches that demand accurate quantification of gene expression and local protein concentrations. Such approaches have benefited greatly from the revolution in genetic engineering sparked by CRISPR/Cas9. By facilitating the tagging of genes at their genomic loci, CRISPR/Cas9 allows us to use fluorescence to monitor proteins that are expressed at or near endogenous levels under native regulatory control. However, due to their typically lower expression levels, quantitative experiments using endogenously-tagged genes can run into limits imposed by autofluorescence (AF). AF is often a particular challenge in the illumination bands occupied by the most efficient fluorescent proteins (GFP, mNeonGreen). Stimulated by our work in C. elegans, we describe and validate Spectral Autofluorescence Image correction By Regression (SAIBR), a simple, platform-independent protocol, and associated GUI-based FIJI plugin to correct for autofluorescence using standard filter sets and illumination conditions. Fully validated for use in C. elegans embryos and tested in diverse systems, including starfish oocytes and fission yeast, SAIBR achieves accurate quantitation of fluorophore signal and enables reliable detection and quantification of even weakly expressed proteins. Thus, SAIBR provides a highly accessible, low barrier way to incorporate AF correction as standard for researchers working on a broad variety of cell and developmental systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {The calculation of rate coefficients is a discipline of nonlinear science of importance to much of physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single-and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.

The establishment and maintenance of a polarized epithelial cell with apical, basolateral and ciliary surface domains is guided by an epithelial polarity programme (EPP) that is controlled by a network of protein and lipid regulators. The EPP is organized in response to extracellular cues and is executed through the establishment of an apical-basal axis, intercellular junctions, epithelial-specific cytoskeletal rearrangements and a polarized trafficking machinery. Recent studies have provided insight into the interactions of the EPP with the polarized trafficking machinery and how these regulate epithelial polarization and depolarization. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {PAR proteins distribute asymmetrically across the anterior-posterior axis of the 1-cell-stage C. elegans embryo, and function to establish subsequent anterior-posterior asymmetries. By the end of the 4-cell stage, anteriorly localized PAR proteins, such as PAR-3 and PAR-6, redistribute to the outer, apical surfaces of cells, whereas posteriorly localized PAR proteins, such as PAR-1 and PAR-2, redistribute to the inner, basolateral surfaces. Because PAR proteins are provided maternally, distinguishing apicobasal from earlier anterior-posterior functions requires a method that selectively prevents PAR activity after the 1-cell stage. In the present study we generated hybrid PAR proteins that are targeted for degradation after the 1-cell stage. Embryos containing the hybrid PAR proteins had normal anterior-posterior polarity, but showed defects in apicobasal asymmetries associated with gastrulation. Ectopic separations appeared between lateral surfaces of cells that are normally tightly adherent, cells that ingress during gastrulation failed to accumulate nonmuscle myosin at their apical surfaces and ingression was slowed. Thus, PAR proteins function in both apicobasal and anterior-posterior asymmetry during the first few cell cycles of embryogenesis.},

abstract = {Background: The centrosome is the major microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in dividing cells and in many postmitotic, differentiated cells. In other cell types, however, MTOC function is reassigned from the centrosome to noncentrosomal sites. Here, we analyze how MTOC function is reassigned to the apical membrane of C. elegans intestinal cells. Results: After the terminal intestinal cell division, the centrosomes and nuclei move near the future apical membranes, and the postmitotic centrosomes lose all, or nearly all, of their associated microtubules. We show that microtubule-nucleating proteins such as $\gamma$-tubulin and CeGrip-1 that are centrosome components in dividing cells become localized to the apical membrane, which becomes highly enriched in microtubules. Our results suggest that centrosomes are critical to specify the apical membrane as the new MTOC. First, $\gamma$-tubulin appears to redistribute directly from the migrating centrosome onto the lateral then apical membrane. Second, $\gamma$-tubulin fails to accumulate apically in wild-type cells following laser ablation of the centrosome. We show that centrosomes localize apically by first moving toward lateral foci of the conserved polarity proteins PAR-3 and PAR-6 and then move together with these foci toward the future apical surface. Embryos lacking PAR-3 fail to localize their centrosomes apically and have aberrant localization of $\gamma$-tubulin and CeGrip-1. Conclusions: These data suggest that PAR proteins contribute to apical polarity in part by determining centrosome position and that the reassignment of MTOC function from centrosomes to the apical membrane is associated with a physical hand-off of nucleators of microtubule assembly. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The apicobasal polarity of epithelial cells is critical for organ morphogenesis and function, and loss of polarity can promote tumorigenesis. Most epithelial cells form when precursor cells receive a polarization cue, develop distinct apical and basolateral domains and assemble junctions near their apical surface. The scaffolding protein PAR-3 regulates epithelial cell polarity, but its cellular role in the transition from precursor cell to polarized epithelial cell has not been determined in vivo. Here, we use a targeted protein-degradation strategy to remove PAR-3 from C. elegans embryos and examine its cellular role as intestinal precursor cells become polarized epithelial cells. At initial stages of polarization, PAR-3 accumulates in cortical foci that contain Ecadherin, other adherens junction proteins, and the polarity proteins PAR-6 and PKC-3. Using live imaging, we show that PAR-3 foci move apically and cluster, and that PAR-3 is required to assemble E-cadherin into foci and for foci to accumulate at the apical surface. We propose that PAR-3 facilitates polarization by promoting the initial clustering of junction and polarity proteins that then travel and accumulate apically. Unexpectedly, superficial epidermal cells form apical junctions in the absence of PAR-3, and we show that PAR-6 has a PAR-3-independent role in these cells to promote apical junction maturation. These findings indicate that PAR-3 and PAR-6 function sequentially to position and mature apical junctions, and that the requirement for PAR-3 can vary in different types of epithelial cells.},

Here, we repurpose an endogenous protein degradation system to rapidly remove targeted C. elegans proteins. We show that upon expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-recognition subunit ZIF-1, proteins tagged with the ZF1 zinc-finger domain can be quickly degraded in all somatic cell types examined with temporal and spatial control. We demonstrate that genes can be engineered to become conditional loss-of-function alleles by introducing sequences encoding the ZF1 tag into endogenous loci.

abstract = {Most proteins fold into 3D structures that determine how they function and orchestrate the biological processes of the cell. Recent developments in computational methods have led to protein structure predictions that have reached the accuracy of experimentally determined models. While this has been independently verified, the implementation of these methods across structural biology applications remains to be tested. Here, we evaluate the use of AlphaFold 2 (AF2) predictions in the study of characteristic structural elements; the impact of missense variants; function and ligand binding site predictions; modelling of interactions; and modelling of experimental structural data. For 11 proteomes, an average of 25% additional residues can be confidently modelled when compared to homology modelling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the PDB. AF2-based predictions of protein disorder and protein complexes surpass state-of-the-art tools and AF2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared to experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered. In summary, we find that these advances are likely to have a transformative impact in structural biology and broader life science research. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {a r t i c l e s Post-translational modification by Ub regulates protein functions by altering their stability, activity, localization and protein-protein interaction network and is therefore essential for diverse biological processes. Ub conjugation requires the consecutive actions of three classes of enzymes: Ub-activating enzyme (E1), E2 and E3 (ref. 1). Initially, an E1 activates and transfers Ub to an E2, and a covalent thioester is formed between E2's catalytic cysteine and the C-terminal glycine on the tail of Ub. Subsequently, an E3 recruits substrate and E2$\sim$Ub to catalyze the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of Ub and an amino group of a lysine side chain on a protein substrate. E3s confer specificity to ubiquitination by promoting Ub transfer to select substrates; defects in E3 function are associated with many major disease pathologies including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic disease 2,3. Over 600 E3s have been identified in mammals, and most belong to the RING family of E3 ligases (reviewed in refs. 4,5). RING E3s act as scaffolds, simultaneously recruiting both substrate and E2$\sim$Ub through different domains to promote Ub transfer in the absence of a covalent E3-Ub intermediate. The RING-finger domain is essential for the recruitment of E2$\sim$Ub and comprises a defined motif of cysteine and histidine residues that bind two zinc ions in a 'cross-brace' arrangement. Several types of RING E3s have been recognized and classified according to the oligomeric state required for function. Regardless of type, the RING-E2 interface is always distal to the E2 active site in RING E3-E2 complex structures 6-9 , and biochemical and recent structural studies suggest that all types promote Ub transfer through an allosteric mechanism in which multiple interactions between the E3, E2 and Ub lock the conformation of the tail of Ub, thereby activating the thioester bond for nucleophilic attack 10-13. E2-mediated interactions with the Ile44 surface of Ub are an essential component of this mechanism 14,15 , and for dimeric RING E3s, recent structural studies of RING-E2-Ub complexes have shown that E3-mediated interactions with the Ile36 surface of Ub are also crucial 12,13. These Ile36 surface interactions are facilitated by a cross-dimer arrangement in which one subunit of the RING dimer binds E2 and Ub's Ile36 surface, and the tail of the second subunit also binds this Ub surface. Both RING-and dimer tail-mediated interactions with Ub are required for optimal Ub transfer. In monomeric RING E3s, the RING domain can mediate interactions with the Ile36 surface of Ub, but whether this is sufficient for optimal Ub transfer or requires an additional Ub-interacting structural component such as the tail in RING E3 dimers is unclear. The monomeric family of CBL RING E3 ligases (c-CBL, CBL-B and CBL-C) attenuate nonreceptor and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling by ubiquitinating and thereby directing these kinases for degradation through the endocytic or proteasomal pathway (reviewed in ref. 16). Members of the CBL family share a highly conserved N terminus comprising a tyrosine kinase-binding domain (TKBD), a linker helix region (LHR) and a RING domain ($\sim$435 amino acids). The C terminus is more variable, comprising a proline-rich region and an extension. The TKBD contains a phosphotyrosine-recognition motif that functions as a substrate-binding site, in which phosphor-ylated RTKs and non-RTKs such as epidermal growth factor receptor and ZAP-70, respectively, are recruited for ubiquitination 17-19. Phosphorylation of a strictly conserved tyrosine within the LHR (Tyr363 in CBL-B, Tyr371 in c-CBL and Tyr341 in CBL-C) enhances ligase activity and is required for CBL-mediated ubiquitination of RTKs 17,20,21. To investigate how monomeric RING E3s promote Ub transfer, we used CBL as a model system and determined the structure of a fragment of phosphorylated Tyr363 (pTyr363)-CBL-B encompassing the TKBD, LHR and RING domain (residues 36-427, hereby referred to as CBL-B, Fig. 1a) bound to a ZAP-70 substrate peptide and RING E3 ligases catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin (Ub) from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme thioesterified with Ub (E2$\sim$Ub) to substrate. For RING E3 dimers, the RING domain of one subunit and tail of the second cooperate to prime Ub, but how this is accomplished by monomeric RING E3s in the absence of a tail-like component is currently unknown. Here, we present a crystal structure of a monomeric RING E3, Tyr363-phosphorylated human CBL-B, bound to a stabilized Ub-linked E2, revealing a similar mechanism in activating E2$\sim$Ub. Both pTyr363 and the pTyr363-induced element interact directly with Ub's Ile36 surface, improving the catalytic efficiency of Ub transfer by $\sim$200-fold. Hence, interactions outside the canonical RING domain are crucial for optimizing Ub transfer in both monomeric and dimeric RING E3s. We propose that an additional non-RING Ub-priming element may be a common RING E3 feature. npg},

abstract = {PAR-6 is a conserved protein important for establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in a variety of metazoans. PAR-6 proteins function together with PAR-3, aPKC and CDC-42. Mechanistic details of their interactions, however, are not fully understood. We studied the biochemical interactions between C. elegans PAR-6 and its binding partners and tested the requirements of these interactions in living worms. We show that PB1 domain-mediated binding of PAR-6 to PKC-3 is necessary for polarity establishment and PAR-6 cortical localization in C. elegans embryos. We also show that binding of PAR-6 and PAR-3 is mediated in vitro by a novel type of PDZ-PDZ interaction; the $\beta$C strand of PAR-6 PDZ binds the $\beta$D strand of PAR-3 PDZ1. However, this interaction is dispensable in vivo for PAR-6 function throughout the life of C. elegans. Mutations that specifically abolish conventional ligand binding to the PAR-6 PDZ domain also failed to affect PAR-6 function in vivo. We conclude that PAR-6 binding to PKC-3, but not to PAR-3 nor to a conventional PDZ ligand, is required for PAR-6 cortical localization and function in C. elegans. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic polarity requires the asymmetrically distributed proteins PAR-3, PAR-6 and PKC-3. The rho family GTPase CDC-42 regulates the activities of these proteins in mammals, flies and worms. To clarify its mode of action in C. elegans we disrupted the interaction between PAR-6 and CDC-42 in vivo, and also determined the distribution of GFP-tagged CDC-42 in the early embryo. Mutant PAR-6 proteins unable to interact with CDC-42 accumulated asymmetrically, at a reduced level, but this asymmetry was not maintained during the first division. We also determined that constitutively active GFP{proportion}CDC-42 becomes enriched in the anterior during the first cell cycle in a domain that overlaps with PAR-6. The asymmetry is dependent on PAR-2, PAR-5 and PAR-6. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of constitutively active GFP{proportion}CDC-42 increased the size of the anterior domain. We conclude that the CDC-42 interaction with PAR-6 is not required for the initial establishment of asymmetry but is required for maximal cortical accumulation of PAR-6 and to maintain its asymmetry. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {PAR proteins play roles in the establishment and maintenance of polarity in many different cell types in metazoans. In C. elegans, polarity established in the one-cell embryo determines the anteroposterior axis of the developing animal and is essential to set the identities of the early blastomeres. PAR-1 and PAR-2 colocalize at the posterior cortex of the embryo. PAR-3, PAR-6 and PKC-3 (aPKC) colocalize at the anterior cortex of the embryo. A process of mutual exclusion maintains the anterior and posterior protein domains. We present results indicating that a homolog of the Hsp90 co-chaperone Cdc37 plays a role in dynamic interactions among the PAR proteins. We show that CDC-37 is required for the establishment phase of embryonic polarity; that CDC-37 reduction allows PAR-3-independent cortical accumulation of PAR-6 and PKC-3; and that CDC-37 is required for the mutual exclusion of the anterior and posterior group PAR proteins. Our results indicate that CDC-37 acts in part by maintaining PKC-3 levels and in part by influencing the activity or levels of other client proteins. Loss of the activities of these client proteins reveals that there are two sites for PAR-6 cortical association, one dependent on CDC-42 and not associated with PAR-3, and the other independent of CDC-42 and co-localizing with PAR-3. We propose that, in wild-type embryos, CDC-37-mediated inhibition of the CDC-42-dependent binding site and PAR-3-mediated release of this inhibition provide a key mechanism for the anterior accumulation of PAR-6.},

Unlike other members of the PKC family, aPKC has no well-defined plasma membrane (PM) or calcium binding domains, leading to the assumption that its subcellular localization relies exclusively on protein-protein interactions. Here we show that in both Drosophila and mammalian cells, the pseudosubstrate region (PSr) of aPKC acts as a polybasic domain capable of targeting aPKC to the PM via electrostatic binding to PM PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. However, physical interaction between aPKC and Par-6 is required for the PM-targeting of aPKC, likely by allosterically exposing the PSr to bind PM. Binding of Par-6 also inhibits aPKC kinase activity, and such inhibition can be relieved through Par-6 interaction with apical polarity protein Crumbs. Our data suggest a potential mechanism in which allosteric regulation of polybasic PSr by Par-6 couples the control of both aPKC subcellular localization and spatial activation of its kinase activity.},

abstract = {Rho GTPases regulate a diverse range of processes that are dependent on their proper cellular localization. The membrane localization of these GTPases is due in large part to their carboxyl- terminal geranylgeranyl moiety. In addition, most of the Rho family members contain a cluster of positively charged residues (i.e. a "polybasic domain"), directly preceding their geranylgeranyl moiety, and it has been suggested that this domain serves to fine-tune their localization among different cellular membrane sites. Here, we have taken a closer look at the role of the polybasic domain of Cdc42 in its ability to bind to membranes and induce the transformation of fibroblasts. A FRET assay for the binding of Cdc42 to liposomes of defined composition showed that Cdc42 associates more strongly with liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) when compared either with uncharged control membranes or with liposomes containing a charge-equivalent amount of phosphatidylserine. The carboxyl-terminal di-arginine motif (Arg-186 and Arg-187) was shown to play an essential role in the binding of Cdc42 to PIP 2-containing membranes. We further showed that substitutions for the di-arginine motif, when introduced within a constitutively active ("fast cycling") Cdc42(F28L) background, had little effect on the ability of the activated Cdc42 mutant to induce microspikes/filopodia in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas they eliminated its ability to transform fibroblasts. Taken together, these findings suggest that the di-arginine motif within the carboxyl terminus of Cdc42 is necessary for this GTPase to bind at membrane sites containing PIP 2, where it can initiate signaling activities that are essential for the oncogenic transformation of cells. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {A complex of atypical PKC and Par6 is a common regulator for cell polarity-related processes, which is an essential clue to evolutionary conserved cell polarity regulation. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the complex of PKC$\iota$ and Par6$\alpha$ PB1 domains to a resolution of 1.5 {\AA}. Both PB1 domains adopt a ubiquitin fold. PKC$\iota$ PB1 presents an OPR, PC. and AID (OPCA) motif, 28 amino acid residues with acidic and hydrophobic residues, which interacts with the conserved lysine residue of Par6$\alpha$ PB1 in a front and back manner. On the interface, several salt bridges are formed including the conserved acidic residues on the OPCA motif of PKC$\iota$ PB1 and the conserved lysine residue on the Par6$\alpha$ PB1. Structural comparison of the PKC$\iota$ and Par6$\alpha$ PB1 complex with the p40phox and p67phox PB1 domain complex, subunits of neutrophil NADPH oxidase, reveals that the specific interaction is achieved by tilting the interface so that the insertion or extension in the sequence is engaged in the specificity determinant. The PB1 domain develops the interaction surface on the ubiquitin fold to increase the versatility of molecular interaction. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Proper establishment of cell polarity is essential for development. In the one-cell C. elegans embryo, a centrosome-localised signal provides spatial information for polarity establishment. It is hypothesised that this signal causes local inhibition of the cortical actomyosin network, and breaks symmetry to direct partitioning of the PAR proteins. However, the molecular nature of the centrosomal signal that triggers cortical anisotropy in the actomyosin network to promote polarity establishment remains elusive. Here, we discover that depletion of Aurora A kinase (AIR-1 in C. elegans) causes pronounced cortical contractions on the embryo surface, and this creates more than one PAR-2 polarity axis. This function of AIR-1 appears to be independent of its role in microtubule nucleation. Importantly, upon AIR-1 depletion, centrosome positioning becomes dispensable in dictating the PAR-2 axis. Moreover, we uncovered that a Rho GEF, ECT-2, acts downstream of AIR-1 in regulating contractility and PAR-2 localisation, and, notably, AIR-1 depletion influences ECT-2 cortical localisation. Overall, this study provides a novel insight into how an evolutionarily conserved centrosome Aurora A kinase inhibits promiscuous PAR-2 domain formation to ensure singularity in the polarity establishment axis.},

Ubiquitin is conjugated to target proteins through the sequential actions of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and ubiquitin-protein ligases. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has one ubiquitin-activating enzyme, twenty putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and potentially hundreds of ubiquitin-protein ligases. Research in C. elegans has focused on the cellular functions of ubiquitin pathway components in the context of organismal development. A combination of forward genetics, reverse genetics, and genome-wide RNAi screens has provided information on the loss-of-function phenotypes for the majority of C. elegans ubiquitin pathway components. Additionally, detailed analysis of several classes of ubiquitin-protein ligases has led to the identification of their substrates and the molecular pathways that they regulate.

By uncoupling unequal inheritance of PAR proteins from that of fate determinants during cell division, we demonstrate that changes in the balance between PAR-2 and PAR-6 can be sufficient to re-program the division modes from symmetric to asymmetric and vice versa in two daughter cells. The division mode adopted occurs independently of asymmetry in cytoplasmic fate determinants, cell-size asymmetry, and cell-cycle asynchrony between sister cells. We propose that the balance between PAR proteins represents an intrinsic self-organizing cue for the specification of the two division modes during development.},

We describe how different techniques may be suited to specific types of biological data, and also discuss some best practices and points to consider when one is embarking on experiments involving machine learning. Some emerging directions in machine learning methodology are also discussed.},

abstract = {Directed evolution circumvents our profound ignorance of how a protein's sequence encodes its function by using iterative rounds of random mutation and artificial selection to discover new and useful proteins. Proteins can be tuned to adapt to new functions or environments by simple adaptive walks involving small numbers of mutations. Directed evolution studies have shown how rapidly some proteins can evolve under strong selection pressures and, because the entire 'fossil record' of evolutionary intermediates is available for detailed study, they have provided new insight into the relationship between sequence and function. Directed evolution has also shown how mutations that are functionally neutral can set the stage for further adaptation.},

RNF4 is an E3 ligase containing an N-terminal domain that binds its polySUMO substrates and a C-terminal RING domain responsible for dimerization. To investigate how RNF4 activity is controlled, we increased polySUMO substrate concentration by ablating expression of SUMO protease SENP6. Accumulation of SUMO chains invivo leads to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of RNF4. Invitro we demonstrate that at concentrations equivalent to those found invivo RNF4 is predominantly monomeric and inactive as an ubiquitin E3 ligase. However, in the presence of SUMO chains, RNF4 is activated by dimerization, leading to both substrate ubiquitylation and autoubiquitylation, responsible for degradation of RNF4. Thus the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of RNF4 is directly linked to the availability of its polySUMO substrates. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Although the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine is comparatively abundant, its contribution to the surface charge of individual cellular membranes is unknown, partly because of the lack of reagents to analyze its distribution in intact cells. We developed a biosensor to study the subcellular distribution of phosphatidylserine and found that it binds the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane, as well as endosomes and lysosomes. The negative charge associated with the presence of phosphatidylserine directed proteins with moderately positive charge to the endocytic pathway.

abstract = {The retroviral structural protein Gag binds to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM), and many cellular proteins do so as well. We used Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag together with membrane sensors to study the principles governing peripheral protein membrane binding, including electrostatics, specific recognition of phospholipid headgroups, sensitivity to phospholipid acyl chain compositions, preference for membrane order, and protein multimerization. We used an in vitro liposome-pelleting assay to test protein membrane binding properties of Gag, the well-characterized MARCKS peptide, a series of fluorescent electrostatic sensor proteins (mNG-KRn), and the specific phosphatidylserine (PS) binding protein Evectin2. RSV Gag and mNG-KRn bound well to membranes with saturated and unsaturated acyl chains, whereas the MARCKS peptide and Evectin2 preferentially bound to membranes with unsaturated acyl chains. To further discriminate whether the primary driving force for Gag membrane binding is electrostatic interactions or preference for membrane order, we measured protein binding to giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) containing the same PS concentration in both disordered (Ld) and ordered (Lo) phases. RSV Gag and mNG-KRn membrane association followed membrane charge, independent of membrane order. Consistent with pelleting data, the MARCKS peptide showed preference for the Ld domain. Surprisingly, the PS sensor Evectin2 bound to the PS-rich Ld domain with 10-fold greater affinity than to the PS-rich Lo domain. In summary, we found that RSV Gag shows no preference for membrane order, while proteins with reported membrane-penetrating domains show preference for disordered membranes. IMPORTANCE Retroviral particles assemble on the PM and bud from infected cells. Our understanding of how Gag interacts with the PM and how different membrane properties contribute to overall Gag assembly is incomplete. This study examined how membrane charge and membrane order influence Gag membrane association. Consistent with previous work on RSV Gag, we report here that electrostatic interactions provide the primary driving force for RSV Gag membrane association. Using phase-separated GUVs with known lipid composition of the Ld and Lo phases, we demonstrate for the first time that RSV Gag is sensitive to membrane charge but not membrane order. In contrast, the cellular protein domain MARCKS and the PS sensor Evectin2 show preference for disordered membranes. We also demonstrate how to define GUV phase composition, which could serve as a tool in future studies of protein membrane interactions.},

abstract = {A key event at the onset of development is the activation of a contractile actomyosin cortex during the oocyte-to-embryo transition. We here report on the discovery that in C. elegans oocytes, actomyosin cortex activation is supported by the emergence of thousands of short-lived protein condensates rich in F-actin, N-WASP, and ARP2/3 that form an active micro-emulsion. A phase portrait analysis of the dynamics of individual cortical condensates reveals that condensates initially grow, and then switch to disassembly before dissolving completely. We find that in contrast to condensate growth via diffusion, the growth dynamics of cortical condensates are chemically driven. Remarkably, the associated chemical reactions obey mass action kinetics despite governing both composition and size. We suggest that the resultant condensate dynamic instability suppresses coarsening of the active micro-emulsion, ensures reaction kinetics that are independent of condensate size, and prevents runaway F-actin nucleation during the formation of the first cortical actin meshwork. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {The leucine zipper motif is a characteristic amino acid sequence found in dimeric DNA‐binding proteins. Computer‐generated models for leucine zippers were constructed as $\alpha$‐helical coiled dimers with leucine repeated every seventh residue. An empirical Gibbs free energy, $\Delta$G, function which incorporates hydrophobic force, electrostatic interactions, and conformational entropy loss as the major intermolecular interactions was used to estimate the $\Delta$G of dimer formation in fos, jun, and GCN4 zipper sequences. The calculations showed that complexes known to form stable homo‐ or heterodimers have favorable (negative) $\Delta$G, while other less stable complexes have unfavorable (positive) $\Delta$G. Leucines in position d of the coiled coil contribute large hydrophobic stabilization energies while residues in the a position contribute less to dimer stability. Hydrophobic contributions show little sequence specificity, however, and do not contribute significantly to homo/heterodimer preference. Charged residues in the e and g positions, on the other hand, determine homo/heterodimer specificity. In GCN4 homodimers, residues GLU e1, Glu b2, Lys g2, and Lys e4 greatly contribute to dimer stability. The preferential stability of fos‐jun heterodimer over the jun‐jun and fos‐fos homodimers is primarily due to the side chains Asp b1, Glu g1, Asp b2, Glu e2, Glu g2, Glu g3, and Lys a5 of the fos helix, and Arg c1, Lys g1, Lys b2, Lys e2, Arg e4, and Glu g4 of the jun helix.

abstract = {The thermal stability of a 56 amino acid fragment of GCN4 has been studied by high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. This fragment contains the leucine zipper and part of the basic region. The thermal unfolding of GCN4-56 is a reversible process and can be well represented by a reaction of the form N2 * 2U, indicating that the unfolding of the leuzine zipper is a two-state process in which the helices are only stable when they are in the coiled-coil conformation. As expected, the transition temperature is concentration dependent. At pH 7.06 and a protein concentration of 5 X ^1 M the transition temperature is close to 70 °C while at 5 X 10"6 M it is close to 50 °C. The enthalpy change for unfolding is 31.5 kcal mol{\textperiodcentered}1 at 70 °C. Since the isolated helices are unstable, interactions at the interface between the two helices play a key role in the stabilization of the native dimer. These interactions primarily involve the burial of apolar surface from the solvent (hydrophobic effect) and electrostatic interactions. Structural thermodynamic calculations have permitted a dissection of the magnitude of the various contributions to the total Gibbs free energy of stabilization. Landshultz et al.

abstract = {Spindle positioning is an essential feature of asymmetric cell division. The conserved PAR proteins together with heterotrimeric G proteins control spindle positioning in animal cells, but how these are linked is not known. In C. elegans, PAR protein activity leads to asymmetric spindle placement through cortical asymmetry of G$\alpha$ regulators GPR-1/2. Here, we establish that the casein kinase 1 gamma CSNK-1 and a PIP2 synthesis enzyme (PPK-1) transduce PAR polarity to asymmetric G$\alpha$ regulation. PPK-1 is posteriorly enriched in the one-celled embryo through PAR and CSNK-1 activities. Loss of CSNK-1 causes uniformly high PPK-1 levels, high symmetric cortical levels of GPR-1/2 and LIN-5, and increased spindle pulling forces. In contrast, knockdown of ppk-1 leads to low GPR-1/2 levels and decreased spindle forces. Furthermore, loss of CSNK-1 leads to increased levels of PIP2. We propose that asymmetric generation of PIP2 by PPK-1 directs the posterior enrichment of GPR-1/2 and LIN-5, leading to posterior spindle displacement. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we present AutoSpill, an alternative method for calculating spillover coefficients. The approach combines automated gating of cells, calculation of an initial spillover matrix based on robust linear regression, and iterative refinement to reduce error. Moreover, autofluorescence can be compensated out, by processing it as an endogenous dye in an unstained control. AutoSpill uses single-color controls and is compatible with common flow cytometry software.

abstract = {Due to the overlapping emission spectra of fluorophores, fluorescence microscopy images often have bleed-through problems, leading to a false positive detection. This problem is almost unavoidable when the samples are labeled with three or more fluorophores, and the situation is complicated even further when imaged under a multiphoton microscope. Several methods have been developed and commonly used by biologists for fluorescence microscopy spectral unmixing, such as linear unmixing, non-negative matrix factorization, deconvolution, and principal component analysis. However, they either require pre-knowledge of emission spectra or restrict the number of fluorophores to be the same as detection channels, which highly limits the real-world applications of those spectral unmixing methods. In this paper, we developed a robust and flexible spectral unmixing method: Learning Unsupervised Means of Spectra (LUMoS), which uses an unsupervised machine learning clustering method to learn individual fluorophores' spectral signatures from mixed images, and blindly separate channels without restrictions on the number of fluorophores that can be imaged. This method highly expands the hardware capability of two-photon microscopy to simultaneously image more fluorophores than is possible with instrumentation alone. Experimental and simulated results demonstrated the robustness of LUMoS in multi-channel separations of two-photon microscopy images. We also extended the application of this method to background/autofluorescence removal and colocalization analysis. Lastly, we integrated this tool into ImageJ to offer an easy to use spectral unmixing tool for fluorescence imaging. LUMoS allows us to gain a higher spectral resolution and obtain a cleaner image without the need to upgrade the imaging hardware capabilities.},

The peripheries of this paradigm, however, start to unravel when considering the co-operation between proteins and the membrane in signalling processes. Intrinsically disordered regions hold distinct advantages over folded domains in terms of their binding promiscuity, sensitivity to their particular environment and their ease of modulation through post-translational modifications. Low sequence complexity and bias towards charged residues are also favourable for the multivalent electrostatic interactions that occur at the surfaces of lipid bilayers. This review looks at the principles behind the successful marriage between protein disorder and membranes in addition to the role of this partnership in modifying and regulating signalling in cellular processes.

The deviation from pure Brownian motion, generally referred to as anomalous diffusion, has received large attention in the scientific literature to describe many physical scenarios. Several methods, based on classical statistics and machine learning approaches, have been developed to characterize anomalous diffusion from experimental data, which are usually acquired as particle trajectories. With the aim to assess and compare the available methods to characterize anomalous diffusion, we have organized the Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge (http://www.andi-challenge.org/). Specifically, the AnDi Challenge will address three different aspects of anomalous diffusion characterization, namely: (i) Inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent. (ii) Identification of the underlying diffusion model. (iii) Segmentation of trajectories. Each problem includes sub-tasks for different number of dimensions (1D, 2D and 3D). In order to compare the various methods, we have developed a dedicated open-source framework for the simulation of the anomalous diffusion trajectories that are used for the training and test datasets. The challenge was launched on March 1, 2020, and consists of three phases. Currently, the participation to the first phase is open. Submissions will be automatically evaluated and the performance of the top-scoring methods will be thoroughly analyzed and compared in an upcoming article.},

abstract = {The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major intracellular membrane system. The ER is essential for protein and lipid biosynthesis, transport of proteins along the secretory pathway, and calcium storage. Here, we describe our investigations into the dynamics and regulation of the ER in the early Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. Using a GFP fusion to the ER-resident signal peptidase SP12, we observed the morphological transitions of the ER through fertilization and the early cell-cycles in living embryos. These transitions were tightly coordinated with the division cycle: upon onset of mitosis, the ER formed structured sheets that redispersed at the initiation of cleavage. Although microtubules were not required for the transition of the ER between these different states, the actin cytoskeleton facilitated the dispersal of the ER at the end of mitosis. The ER had an asymmetric distribution in the early embryo, which was dependent on the establishment of polarity by the PAR proteins. The small GTPase ARF-1 played an essential role in the ER dynamics, although this function appeared to be unrelated to the role of ARF-1 in vesicular traffic. In addition, the ER-resident heat shock protein BiP and a homologue of the AAA ATPase Cdc48/p97 were found to be crucial for the ER transitions. Both proteins have been implicated in homotypic ER membrane fusion. We provide evidence that homotypic membrane fusion is required to form the sheet structure in the early embryo.},

abstract = {Multi-component signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory circuits underpin integrated cellular responses to perturbations. A recurring set of network motifs serve as the basic building blocks of these molecular signalling networks. This review focuses on ultrasensitive response motifs (URMs) that amplify small percentage changes in the input signal into larger percentage changes in the output response. URMs generally possess a sigmoid input-output relationship that is steeper than the Michaelis-Menten type of response and is often approximated by the Hill function. Six types of URMs can be commonly found in intracellular molecular networks and each has a distinct kinetic mechanism for signal amplification. These URMs are: (i) positive cooperative binding, (ii) homo-multimerization, (iii) multistep signalling, (iv) molecular titration, (v) zero-order covalent modification cycle and (vi) positive feedback. Multiple URMs can be combined to generate highly switch-like responses. Serving as basic signal amplifiers, these URMs are essential for molecular circuits to produce complex nonlinear dynamics, including multistability, robust adaptation and oscillation. These dynamic properties are in turn responsible for higher-level cellular behaviours, such as cell fate determination, homeostasis and biological rhythm. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the 3-D structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence, the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8, has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even where no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experiment in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

@article{Reuveni2014,
abstract = {The Michaelis-Menten equation provides a hundred-year-old prediction by which any increase in the rate of substrate unbinding will decrease the rate of enzymatic turnover. Surprisingly, this prediction was never tested experimentally nor was it scrutinized using modern theoretical tools. Here we show that unbinding may also speed up enzymatic turnover-turning a spotlight to the fact that its actual role in enzymatic catalysis remains to be determined experimentally. Analytically constructing the unbinding phase space, we identify four distinct categories of unbinding: inhibitory, excitatory, superexcitatory, and restorative. A transition in which the effect of unbinding changes from inhibitory to excitatory as substrate concentrations increase, and an overlooked tradeoff between the speed and efficiency of enzymatic reactions, are naturally unveiled as a result. The theory presented herein motivates, and allows the interpretation of, groundbreaking experiments in which existing single-molecule manipulation techniques will be adapted for the purpose of measuring enzymatic turnover under a controlled variation of unbinding rates. As we hereby show, these experiments will not only shed first light on the role of un-binding but will also allow one to determine the time distribution required for the completion of the catalytic step in isolation from the rest of the enzymatic turnover cycle. single enzyme | enzyme kinetics | renewal theory E very enzymatic reaction is composed out of two basic steps: (i) the reversible binding of a substrate molecule to the enzyme and (ii) a catalytic step which gives rise to the formation of the product (1). Controlled variation of the effective binding rate to a free enzyme is attained by altering the concentration of the substrate. The rate of product formation, also known as the turnover rate, can then be measured as a function of this concentration to show a characteristic hyperbolic dependence (2-5). The Michaelis-Menten equation is used to rationalize this observation and interpret the results (2, 6). Recent advancements in single-molecule spectroscopy have gradually made it possible to follow the stochastic activity of individual enzymes over extended periods of time (7-19). Interestingly , the hyperbolic dependence of turnover on substrate concentration remains valid even at the single-molecule level (12, 14). From a theoretical perspective, this result was initially puzzling but is now considered almost universal in the sense that it can be shown to hold under a wide range of modeling assumptions (20, 21). One can thus safely say that the role of binding in Michaelis-Menten enzymatic reactions is well understood. In this paper, we consider the role of unbinding. Rapid advancements in the single-molecule technological front imply that the adaptation of existing single-molecule manipulation techniques (12-14, 18, 22, 23) to allow the measurement of enzymatic turnover under a controlled variation of unbinding rates is now within reach. Single-molecule approaches to biomolecular interaction kinetics (24-26) allow for direct measurements of binding and unbinding rates (27-29). In addition , the combination of single-molecule florescence (16, 18) with single-molecule force spectroscopy (23, 30) marks itself as an especially promising tool in unbinding studies because the fluorescence readout for catalytic activity is expected to be correlated with selective, force-induced, changes of the activation barrier for unbinding (23, 30). Direct manipulation of the sub-strate itself, via atomic force microscopy (13-15), was also shown to be possible, potentially allowing for abrupt premature termination of the catalytic process via force induced unbinding. However, a strong discouragement to embark on a long journey whose aftermath seems to have already been foretold severely diminishes the motivation to pursue the above-mentioned line of investigation-the Michaelis-Menten equation clearly states that any increase in the rate of unbinding must be accompanied by a decrease in the rate of enzymatic turnover. Here, we show that the interplay between turnover and un-binding is rich and more intricate than previously perceived. Interestingly, the problem is analytically tractable and allows for the extraction of a set of simple, far-reaching, conclusions that are formulated in a mathematically closed form. Most importantly , we show that turnover can be accelerated by increasing the unbinding rate when the following conditions hold: (i) Sub-strate concentrations are high; (ii) the unbinding rate is low; and (iii) the coefficient of variation ðC v Þ associated with the distribution of catalysis times is larger than unity. Interestingly, the turnover time distribution has been measured for the enzyme $\beta$-galactosidase, and its C v was found to be a monotonically increasing function of the substrate concentration (peaking at a value of ∼3=2) (12). The turnover time distribution coincides with the catalysis time distribution in the limit of high substrate concentrations and low unbinding rates, suggesting a C v > 1 for the catalysis time distribution of $\beta$-galacto-sidase. Moreover, meticulous data analysis has led previous authors Significance Enzymes are biological catalysts vital to all life processes, and the quest to determine their inner workings continues to attract and fascinate scientists over a broad range of disciplines. With the advent of high-resolution methods of single-molecule spectros-copy, it is now possible to directly observe and manipulate the behavior of individual enzymes in the course of a chemical reaction. Chemistry at the single-molecule level is, however, inherently stochastic and, at times, extremely unintuitive. In this paper, we explain why, and under what circumstances, an increase in the rate at which an enzyme unproductively departs from a bound substrate will-unexpectedly-lead to an acceleration in the rate of product formation. The far-reaching implications of this effect are discussed.},

abstract = {Methods are presented for simulating chemical reaction networks with a spatial resolution that is accurate to nearly the size scale of individual molecules. Using an intuitive picture of chemical reaction systems, each molecule is treated as a point-like particle that diffuses freely in three-dimensional space. When a pair of reactive molecules collide, such as an enzyme and its substrate, a reaction occurs and the simulated reactants are replaced by products. Achieving accurate bimolecular reaction kinetics is surprisingly difficult, requiring a careful consideration of reaction processes that are often overlooked. This includes whether the rate of a reaction is at steady-state and the probability that multiple reaction products collide with each other to yield a back reaction. Inputs to the simulation are experimental reaction rates, diffusion coefficients and the simulation time step. From these are calculated the simulation parameters, including the 'binding radius' and the 'unbinding radius', where the former defines the separation for a molecular collision and the latter is the initial separation between a pair of reaction products. Analytic solutions are presented for some simulation parameters while others are calculated using look-up tables. Capabilities of these methods are demonstrated with simulations of a simple bimolecular reaction and the Lotka-Volterra system. {\textcopyright} 2004 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Using fundamental properties, such as the diffusion constant, we calculate the evolution of the spatial profile and derive from physical, heuristic models the assembly rate for reaction and diffusion limited processes based on the individual particle's interactions with the surface. Finally, we confirm the spatial profile differences between diffusion and reaction limited cases by experimentally measuring the surface assembly between two molecules of similar size, but having different assembly routes.

Activity of the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is a key output of the Par complex as phosphorylation removes substrates from the Par domain. Here, we investigate how diverse, apparently unrelated Par substrates couple phosphorylation to cortical displacement. Each protein contains a basic and hydrophobic (BH) motif that interacts directly with phospholipids and also overlaps with aPKC phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation alters the electrostatic character of the sequence, inhibiting interaction with phospholipids and the cell cortex. We searched for overlapping BH and aPKC phosphorylation site motifs (i.e., putative phosphoregulated BH motifs) in several animal proteomes. Candidate proteins with strong PRBH signals associated with the cell cortex but were displaced into the cytoplasm by aPKC. These findings demonstrate a potentially general mechanism for exclusion of proteins from the Par cortical domain in polarized cells. The mechanism of Par substrate localization and polarization has remained elusive. Bailey and Prehoda identify a phosphorylation-regulated motif that mediates cortical localization and also aPKC-mediated displacement of diverse Par substrates from the cortex. A bioinformatic screen demonstrates that candidate phosphoregulated membrane-association motifs are common in animal proteomes.},

abstract = {How genes are regulated to produce the correct assortment of proteins for every cell type is a fundamental question in biology. For many genes, regulation begins at the DNA level with the use of promoter sequences to control transcription. Regulation can also occur after transcription using sequences in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA to affect mRNA stability and/or translation [1]. The C. elegans gonad is an excellent tissue to study gene regulation during development: In the adult, germ cells are arranged in order of differentiation, with undifferentiated progenitors at one end of the gonad, cells in meiotic prophase in the middle, and gametes at the other end [2]. Using a transgenic assay, we have compared the contribution of promoters and 3′ UTRs to gene regulation during germline development. We find that for most genes tested, 3′ UTRs are sufficient for regulation. With the exception of promoters activated during spermatogenesis, promoters are permissive for expression in all germ cell types (from progenitors to oocytes and sperm). In progenitors, 3′ UTRs inhibit the production of meiotic and oocyte proteins by posttranscriptional mechanisms involving PUF- and KH-domain RNA-binding proteins. Our findings indicate that many genes rely primarily on 3′ UTRs, not promoters, for regulation during germline development. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Obtaining quantitative kinetic parameters from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments generally requires a theoretical analysis of protein mobility and appropriate solutions for FRAP recovery derived for a given geometry. Here we provide a treatment of FRAP recovery for a molecule undergoing a combined process of reversible membrane association and lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane for two commonly used bleach geometries: Stripes, and boxes. Such analysis is complicated by the fact that diffusion of a molecule during photobleaching can lead to broadening of the bleach area, resulting in significant deviations of the actual bleach shape from the desired bleach geometry, which creates difficulty in accurately measuring kinetic parameters. Here we overcome the problem of deviations between actual and idealized bleach geometries by parameterizing, more accurately, the initial postbleach state. This allows for reconstruction of an accurate and analytically tractable approximation of the actual fluorescence distribution. Through simulated FRAP experiments, we demonstrate that this method can be used to accurately measure a broad range of combinations of diffusion constants and exchange rates. Use of this method to analyze the plextrin homology domain of PLC-d1 in Caenorhabditis elegans results in quantitative agreement with prior analysis of this domain in other cells using other methods. Because of the flexibility, relative ease of implementation, and its use of standard, easily obtainable bleach geometries, this method should be broadly applicable to investigation of protein dynamics at the plasma membrane. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

Cln/CDK disrupts Ste5 membrane localization by phosphorylating a cluster of sites that flank a small, basic, membrane-binding motif in Ste5. Effective inhibition of Ste5 signaling requires multiple phosphorylation sites and a substantial accumulation of negative charge, which suggests that Ste5 acts as a sensor for high G1 CDK activity. Thus, Ste5 is an integration point for both external and internal signals. When Ste5 cannot be phosphorylated, pheromone triggers an aberrant arrest of cells outside G1 either in the presence or absence of the CDK-inhibitor protein Far1. These findings define a mechanism and physiological benefit of restricting antiproliferative signaling to G1. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Homo-oligomerisation of proteins is a ubiquitous phenomenon whose exact role remains unclear in many cases. To identify novel functions, this paper provides an exploration of general dynamical mathematical models of homo-oligomerisation. Simulation and analysis of these models show that homo-oligomerisation on its own allows for a remarkable variety of complex dynamic and steady state regulatory behaviour such as transient overshoots or homeostatic control of monomer concentration. If post-translational modifications are considered, however, conventional mass action kinetics lead to thermodynamic inconsistencies due to asymmetric combinatorial expansion of reaction routes. Introducing a conservation principle to balance rate equations re-establishes thermodynamic consistency. Using such balanced models it is shown that oligomerisation can lead to bistability by enabling pseudo-multisite modification and kinetic pseudo-cooperativity via multi-enzyme regulation, thereby constituting a novel motif for bistable modification reactions. Due to these potential signal processing capabilities, homo-oligomerisation could play far more versatile roles in signal transduction than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {Multicellular development depends on generating and precisely positioning distinct cell types within tissues. During leaf development, pores in the epidermis called stomata are spaced at least one cell apart for optimal gas exchange. This pattern is primarily driven by iterative asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) in stomatal progenitors, which generate most of the cells in the tissue. A plasma membrane-associated polarity crescent defined by BREAKING OF ASYMMETRY IN THE STOMATAL LINEAGE (BASL) and BREVIS RADIX family (BRXf) proteins is required for asymmetric divisions and proper stomatal pattern, but the cellular mechanisms that orient ACDs remain unclear. Here, utilizing long-term, quantitative time-lapse microscopy, we identified two oppositely oriented nuclear migrations that precede and succeed ACD during epidermal patterning. The pre- and post-division migrations are dependent on microtubules and actin, respectively, and the polarity crescent is the unifying landmark that is both necessary and sufficient to orient both nuclear migrations. We identified a specific and essential role for MYOXI-I in controlling post-ACD nuclear migration. Loss of MYOXI-I decreases stomatal density, owing to an inability to accurately orient a specific subset of ACDs. Taken together, our analyses revealed successive and polarity-driven nuclear migrations that regulate ACD orientation in the Arabidopsis stomatal lineage.},

abstract = {Aggregation of neuronal protein $\alpha$-synuclein leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils, which are associated with the development of Parkinson's disease. The mechanism of $\alpha$-synuclein pathology is not fully understood and is a subject of active research in the field. To tackle this problem, the fusions of fluorescent proteins to $\alpha$-synuclein C-terminus are often used in cellular and animal studies. The effects induced by such $\alpha$-synuclein sequence extension on $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation propensity are, however, not systematically examined despite the evidence that the negatively charged C-terminus plays a critical role in the regulation of $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation. In this work, we investigated how the charge and length variations of the C-terminus affect the aggregation propensity of $\alpha$-synuclein. To address these questions, we prepared mutants of $\alpha$-synuclein carrying additional moieties of different charge and length at the protein C-terminus. We determined the rates of two different aggregation stages (primary nucleation and elongation) based on a thioflavin T kinetic assay. We observed that all mutants bearing neutrally charged moieties of different length fibrilized slower than wild-type $\alpha$-synuclein. The primary nucleation and elongation rates strongly decreased with increase of the C-terminal extension length. Meanwhile, charge variation of the C-terminus significantly changed the rate of $\alpha$-synuclein nucleation, but did not markedly affect the rate of fibril elongation. Our data demonstrate that both the charge and length of the C-terminus play an important role at the stage of initial fibril formation, but the stage of fibril elongation is affected mainly by the length of C-terminal extension. In addition, our results suggest that there are at least two steps of incorporation of $\alpha$-synuclein monomers into the amyloid fibril: namely, the initial monomer binding to the fibril end (charge-dependent, relatively fast), and the subsequent conformational change of the protein (charge-independent, relatively slow, and thus the rate-limiting step).},

abstract = {Recombinant expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli is well established for a wide range of proteins, although in many cases, purifying soluble and properly folded proteins remains challenging (Sorensen and Mortensen, J Biotechnol 115:113–128, 2005; Correa and Oppezzo, Methods Mol Biol 1258:27–44, 2015). Proteins that contain disulfide bonds (e.g., cytokines, growth factors) are often particularly difficult to purify in soluble form and still need optimizing of protocols in almost every step of the process (Berkmen, Protein Expr Purif 82:240–251, 2012; de Marco, Microb Cell Fact 11:129, 2012). Expression of disulfide bonded proteins in the periplasm of E. coli is one approach that can help to obtain soluble protein with the correct disulfide bridges forming in the periplasm. This offers the appropriate conditions for disulfide formation although periplasmic expression can also result in low expression levels and incorrect folding of the target protein (Schlapschy and Skerra, Methods Mol Biol 705:211–224, 2011). Generation of specific antibodies often requires a specific antigenic sequence of a protein in order to get an efficient immune response and minimize cross-reactivity of antibodies. Larger proteins like GST (Glutathione-S-transferase) or MBP (maltose binding protein) as solubilizing fusion partners are frequently used to keep antigens soluble and immunize animals. This approach has the disadvantage that the immune response against the fusion partner leads to additional antibodies that need to be separated from the antigen-specific antibodies. For both classes of proteins mentioned above, a protocol has been developed and optimized using the human version of small ubiquitin-like modifier 3 (SUMO3) protein and its corresponding protease SenP2. This chapter describes the experimental steps for expression, purification, refolding, and cleavage that are applicable to both disulfide-bonded proteins with a defined structure and random protein fragments for antibody generation or larger peptides with defined sequence that are difficult express on their own.},

abstract = {Genomes encode multiple signals, raising the question of how these different codes are organized along the linear genome sequence. Within protein-coding regions, the redundancy of the genetic code can, in principle, allow for the overlapping encoding of signals in addition to the amino acid sequence, but it is not known to what extent genomes exploit this potential and, if so, for what purpose. Here, we systematically explore whether protein-coding regions accommodate overlapping codes, by comparing the number of occurrences of each possible short sequence within the protein-coding regions of over 700 species from viruses to plants, to the same number in randomizations that preserve amino acid sequence and codon bias. We find that coding regions across all phyla encode additional information, with bacteria carrying more information than eukaryotes. The detailed signals consist of both known and potentially novel codes, including position-dependent secondary RNA structure, bacteria-specific depletion of transcription and translation initiation signals, and eukaryote-specific enrichment of microRNA target sites. Our results suggest that genomes may have evolved to encode extensive overlapping information within protein-coding regions. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Centromeres are unique chromosomal loci that promote the assembly of kinetochores, macromolecular complexes that bind spindle microtubules during mitosis. In most organisms, centromeres lack defined genetic features. Rather, they are specified epigenetically by a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A. The Mis18 complex, comprising the Mis18$\alpha$: Mis18$\beta$ subcomplex and M18BP1, is crucial for CENP-A homeostasis. It recruits the CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP to centromeres and primes it for CENP-A loading. We report here that a specific arrangement of Yippee domains in a human Mis18$\alpha$:Mis18$\beta$ 4:2 hexamer binds two copies of M18BP1 through M18BP1's 140 N-terminal residues. Phosphorylation by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) at two conserved sites in this region destabilizes binding to Mis18$\alpha$:Mis18$\beta$, limiting complex formation to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Using an improved viral 2A peptide co-expression strategy, we demonstrate that CDK1 controls Mis18 complex recruitment to centromeres by regulating oligomerization of M18BP1 through the Mis18$\alpha$:Mis18$\beta$ scaffold.},

However, broad application of 2 A peptides is limited by the lack of systematic comparison of different 2As alone or in combination. Here we characterized the effect of varying gene position and 2As on the expression of proteins encoded in bi-, tri-, or quad-cistronic constructs. Using direct cardiac reprogramming as an example, we further determined the effect of varied 2As on the efficiency of fluorescent cell labeling and cell fate conversion. We found that the expression of fluorophores decreased as it was moved towards the end of the construct while reprogramming was most efficient with the fluorophore at the second position. Moreover, quad-cistronic TPE2A constructs resulted in more efficient reprogramming than 3P2A or PTE2A constructs. We expect that the bi-, tri-, and quad-cistronic vectors constructed here and our results on protein expression ratios from different 2A constructs could serve to guide future utilization of 2A peptides in basic research and clinical applications.},

Importantly, ASSET standardizes the data into an absolute coordinate system to allow robust quantitative comparisons between embryos.

We performed a quantitative assessment of polarity establishment in one-cell stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryos by combining time-lapse microscopy and image analysis. We used our extensive data set to challenge and further specify an extant mathematical model. Using likelihood-based calibration, we uncovered that cooperativity is required for both anterior and posterior PAR complexes. Moreover, we analyzed the dependence of polarity establishment on changes in size or temperature. The observed robustness of PAR domain dimensions in embryos of different sizes is in agreement with a model incorporating fixed protein concentrations and variations in embryo surface/volume ratio. In addition, we quantified the dynamics of polarity establishment over most of the viable temperatures range of C. elegans. Modeling of these data suggests that diffusion of PAR proteins is the process most affected by temperature changes, although cortical flows appear unaffected. Overall, our quantitative analytical framework provides insights into the dynamics of polarity establishment in a developing system.},

abstract = {CRISPR-based genome-editing methods in model organisms are evolving at an extraordinary speed. Whereas the generation of deletion or missense mutants is quite straightforward, the production of endogenous fluorescent reporters is more challenging. We have developed Nested CRISPR, a cloning-free ribonucleoprotein-driven method that robustly produces endogenous fluorescent reporters with EGFP, mCherry or wrmScarlet in Caenorhabditis elegans. This method is based on the division of the fluorescent protein (FP) sequence in three fragments. In the first step, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors (#200 bp) are used to insert the 59 and 39 fragments of the FP in the locus of interest. In the second step, these sequences act as homology regions for homology-directed repair using a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor (PCR product) containing the middle fragment, thus completing the FP sequence. In Nested CRISPR, the first step involving ssDNA donors is a well-established method that yields high editing efficiencies, and the second step is reliable because it uses universal CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) and PCR products. We have also used Nested CRISPR in a nonessential gene to produce a deletion mutant in the first step and a transcriptional reporter in the second step. In the search for modifications to optimize the method, we tested synthetic single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), but did not observe a significant increase in efficiency. To streamline the approach, we combined all step 1 and step 2 reagents in a single injection and were successful in three of five loci tested with editing efficiencies of up to 20%. Finally, we discuss the prospects of this method in the future.},

abstract = {We create and share a new red fluorophore, along with a set of strains, reagents and protocols, to make it faster and easier to label endogenous Caenorhabditis elegans proteins with fluorescent tags. CRISPR-mediated fluorescent labeling of C. elegans proteins is an invaluable tool, but it is much more difficult to insert fluorophore-size DNA segments than it is to make small gene edits. In principle, high-affinity asymmetrically split fluorescent proteins solve this problem in C. elegans: the small fragment can quickly and easily be fused to almost any protein of interest, and can be detected wherever the large fragment is expressed and complemented. However, there is currently only one available strain stably expressing the large fragment of a split fluorescent protein, restricting this solution to a single tissue (the germline) in the highly autofluorescent green channel. No available C. elegans lines express unbound large fragments of split red fluorescent proteins, and even state-of-the-art split red fluorescent proteins are dim compared to the canonical split-sfGFP protein. In this study, we engineer a bright, high-affinity new split red fluorophore, split-wrmScarlet. We generate transgenic C. elegans lines to allow easy single-color labeling in muscle or germline cells and dual-color labeling in somatic cells. We also describe a novel expression strategy for the germline, where traditional expression strategies struggle. We validate these strains by targeting split-wrmScarlet to several genes whose products label distinct organelles, and we provide a protocol for easy, cloning-free CRISPR/Cas9 editing. As the collection of split-FP strains for labeling in different tissues or organelles expands, we will post updates at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3993663.},

Yet recent results indicate that convolutional architectures can outperform recurrent networks on tasks such as audio synthesis and machine translation. Given a new sequence modeling task or dataset, which architecture should one use? We conduct a systematic evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. The models are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory. We conclude that the common association between sequence modeling and recurrent networks should be reconsidered, and convolutional networks should be regarded as a natural starting point for sequence modeling tasks.

abstract = {The anterior-posterior axis of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is elaborated at the one-cell stage by the polarization of the partitioning (PAR) proteins at the cell cortex. Polarization is established under the control of the Rho GTPase RHO-1 and is maintained by the Rho GTPase CDC-42. To understand more clearly the role of the Rho family GTPases in polarization and division of the early embryo, we constructed a fluorescent biosensor to determine the localization of CDC-42 activity in the living embryo. A genetic screen using this biosensor identified one positive (putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor [GEF]) and one negative (putative GTPase activating protein [GAP]) regulator of CDC-42 activity: CGEF-1 and CHIN-1. CGEF-1 was required for robust activation, whereas CHIN-1 restricted the spatial extent of CDC-42 activity. Genetic studies placed CHIN-1 in a novel regulatory loop, parallel to loop described previously, that maintains cortical PAR polarity. We found that polarized distributions of the nonmuscle myosin NMY-2 at the cell cortex are independently produced by the actions of RHO-1, and its effector kinase LET-502, during establishment phase and CDC-42, and its effector kinase MRCK-1, during maintenance phase. CHIN-1 restricted NMY-2 recruitment to the anterior during maintenance phase, consistent with its role in polarizing CDC-42 activity during this phase.},

abstract = {Actin network architecture and dynamics play a central role in cell contractility and tissue morphogenesis. Pulsed contractions driven by RhoA represent a generic mode of actomyosin contractility, but the mechanisms underlying (1) how their specific architecture emerges, and (2) how this architecture supports the contractile function of the network, remain unclear. Here, we combine quantitative microscopy, single-molecule imaging, numerical simulations and simple mathematical modelling, to explore the dynamic network architecture underlying pulsed contraction. We show that during pulsed contractions, two subpopulations of formins are recruited by RhoA from the cytoplasm and bind to the cell surface in the early C. elegans embryo: recruited formins, a functionally inactive population, and elongating formins, which actively participate in actin filaments elongation. Focusing on formin dynamics during pulses, we show that minority elongating formins precede recruited formins, a kinetic dynamics compatible with formins capturing and rapidly saturating barbed ends available for filament elongation. We then show that these elongating formins assemble a polar network of actin, with barbed ends pointing out of the pulse, pointing to a kinetic rather than mechanical control of network architecture. Finally, our numerical simulations demonstrate that this geometry favors rapid network contraction. Our results thus show that formins saturate available actin filaments barbed ends and convert a local, biochemical gradient of RhoA activity into a polar network architecture, thereby driving rapid and efficient network contractility, an important evolutionary feature in a metazoan with a rapid embryonic cell cycles.},

abstract = {Local activity of the small GTPase Cdc42 is critical for cell polarization. Whereas scaffold-mediated positive feedback was proposed to break symmetry of budding yeast cells and produce a single zone of Cdc42 activity, the existence of similar regulation has not been probed in other organisms. Here, we address this problem using rod-shaped cells of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which exhibit zones of active Cdc42-GTP at both cell poles. We implemented the CRY2-CIB1 optogenetic system for acute light-dependent protein recruitment to the plasma membrane, which allowed to directly demonstrate positive feedback. Indeed, optogenetic recruitment of constitutively active Cdc42 leads to co-recruitment of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Scd1 and endogenous Cdc42, in a manner dependent on the scaffold protein Scd2. We show that Scd2 function is dispensable when the positive feedback operates through an engineered interaction between the GEF and a Cdc42 effector, the p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1). Remarkably, this rewired positive feedback confers viability and allows cells to form 2 zones of active Cdc42 even when otherwise essential Cdc42 activators are lacking. These cells further revealed that the small GTPase Ras1 plays a role in both localizing the GEF Scd1 and promoting its activity, which potentiates the positive feedback. We conclude that scaffold-mediated positive feedback, gated by Ras activity, confers robust polarization for rod-shape formation.},

abstract = {Research Article submitted to journal Subject Areas: computational biology, biochemistry, mathematical modelling and simulation Switch-like behaviours in biochemical networks are of fundamental significance in biological signal processing, and exist as two distinct types: ultra-sensitivity and bistability. Here we propose two new models of a reversible covalent-modification cycle with positive autoregulation (PAR)-a motif structure that is thought to be capable of both ultrasensitivity and bistability in different parameter regimes. These new models appeal to a modelling framework that we call complex complete, which accounts fully for the molecular complexities of the underlying signalling mechanisms. Each of the two new models encodes a specific molecular mechanism for PAR. We demonstrate that the modelling simplifications for PAR models that have been used in previous work, which rely on a Michaelian approximation for the enzyme-mediated reactions, are unable to accurately recapitulate the qualitative signalling responses supported by our 'full' complex-complete models. Strikingly, we show that the parameter regimes in which ultrasensitivity and bistability obtain in the complex-complete framework contradict the predictions made by the Michaelian simplification. Our results highlight the critical importance of accurately representing the molecular details of biochemical signalling mechanisms, and strongly suggest that the Michaelian approximation may be inadequate for predictive models of enzyme-mediated chemical reactions with added regulations.},

abstract = {Cells self-organize using reaction-diffusion and fluid-flow principles. Whether bulk membrane flows contribute to cell patterning has not been established. Here, using mathematical modelling, optogenetics and synthetic probes, we show that polarized exocytosis causes lateral membrane flows away from regions of membrane insertion. Plasma membrane-associated proteins with sufficiently low diffusion and/or detachment rates couple to the flows and deplete from areas of exocytosis. In rod-shaped fission yeast cells, zones of Cdc42 GTPase activity driving polarized exocytosis are limited by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). We show that membrane flows pattern the GAP Rga4 distribution and coupling of a synthetic GAP to membrane flows is sufficient to establish the rod shape. Thus, membrane flows induced by Cdc42-dependent exocytosis form a negative feedback restricting the zone of Cdc42 activity. One Sentence Summary Exocytosis causes bulk membrane flows that drag associated proteins and form a negative feedback restricting the exocytic site. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {The dynamics of biological reaction networks are strongly constrained by thermodynamics. An holistic understanding of their behavior and regulation requires mathematical models that observe these constraints. However, kinetic models may easily violate the constraints imposed by the principle of detailed balance, if no special care is taken. Detailed balance demands that in thermodynamic equilibrium all fluxes vanish. We introduce a thermodynamic- kinetic modeling (TKM) formalism that adapts the concepts of potentials and forces from irreversible thermodynamics to kinetic modeling. In the proposed formalism, the thermokinetic potential of a compound is proportional to its concentration. The proportionality factor is a compound-specific parameter called capacity. The thermokinetic force of a reaction is a function of the potentials. Every reaction has a resistance that is the ratio of thermokinetic force and reaction rate. For mass-action type kinetics, the resistances are constant. Since it relies on the thermodynamic concept of potentials and forces, the TKM formalism structurally observes detailed balance for all values of capacities and resistances. Thus, it provides an easy way to formulate physically feasible, kinetic models of biological reaction networks. The TKM formalism is useful for modeling large biological networks that are subject to many detailed balance relations. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

We equalized AB and P1 sizes using acute genetic inactivation or optogenetic manipulation of the spindle positioning protein LIN-5. We uncovered that only some embryos tolerated equalization, and that there was a size asymmetry threshold for viability. Cell lineage analysis of equalized embryos revealed an array of defects, including faster cell cycle progression in P1 descendants, as well as defects in cell positioning, division orientation and cell fate. Moreover, equalized embryos were more susceptible to external compression. Overall, we conclude that unequal first cleavage is essential for invariably successful embryonic development of C. elegans.},

abstract = {Putative intersubunit electrostatic interactions between charged amine acids on the surfaces of the dimer interfaces of leucine zippers (g-e' ion pairs) have been implicated as determinants of dimerization specificity. To evaluate the importance of these ionic interactions in determining the specificity of dimer formation, we constructed a pool of >65,000 GCN4 leucine zipper mutants in which all the e and g positions are occupied by different combinations of alanine, glutamic acid, lysine, or threonine. The oligomerization properties of these mutants were evaluated based on the phenotypes of cells expressing $\lambda$ repressor-leucine zipper fusion proteins. About 90% of the mutants do not form stable homooligomers. Surprisingly, approximately 8% of the mutant sequences have phenotypes consistent with the formation of higher-order (>dimer) oligomers, which can be classified into three types based on sequence features. The oligomerization states of mutants from two of these types were determined by characterizing purified fusion proteins. The Type I mutant behaved as a tetramer under all tested conditions, whereas the Type III mutant formed a variety of higher-order oligomers, depending on the solution conditions. Stable homodimers comprise less than 3% of the pool; several g-e' positions in these mutants could form attractive ion pairs. Putative repulsive ion pairs are not found among the homodimeric mutants. However, patterns of charged residues at the e and g positions do not seem to be sufficient to predict either homodimer or heterodimer formation among the mutants.},

Furthermore, an engineered Cdc42 allele targeted to the membrane independently of these recycling pathways by an amphipathic helix is viable and polarizes spontaneously to multiple sites in fission and budding yeasts. We show that Cdc42 is highly mobile at the membrane and accumulates at sites of activity, where it displays slower mobility. By contrast, a near-immobile transmembrane domain-containing Cdc42 allele supports viability and polarized activity, but does not accumulate at sites of activity.

This structure has been found to mediate the dimerization of two abundant classes of DNA binding proteins: the bZIP and bHLH-Zip proteins. Several workers have reported that amino acids in the e and g positions of the coiled coil can modulate dimerization stability and specificity. Using the bZIP protein VBP as a host molecule, we report a thermodynamic scale ($\Delta$$\Delta$G) for 27 interhelical interactions in 35 proteins between amino acids in the g and the following e positions (g⇆e') of a leucine zipper coiled coil. We have examined the four commonly occurring amino acids in the e and g positions of bZIP proteins, lysine (K), arginine (R), glutamine (Q), glutamic acid (E), as well as the only other remaining charged amino acid aspartic acid (D), and finally alanine (A) as a reference amino acid. These results indicate that E⇆R is the most stable interhelical pair, being 0.35 kcal/mol more stable than E⇆K. A thermodynamic cycle analysis shows that the E⇆R pair is 1.33 kcal/mol more stable than A⇆A with -1.14 kcal/mol of coupling energy ($\Delta$$\Delta$G(int)) coming from the interaction of E with R. The E⇆K coupling energy is only -0.14 kcal/mol. E interacts with more specificity than Q. The R⇆R pair is less stable than the K⇆K by 0.24 kcal/mol. R interacts with more specificity than K. Q forms more stable pairs with the basic amino acids K and R rather than with E. Changing amino acids in the e position to A creates bZIP proteins that form tetramers.},

To understand the circuit mechanisms of this signaling, we characterized the function of two OA neurons, in the input region to the memory center, the mushroom body calyx, in larval Drosophila. Here they target multiple neurons, including olfactory projection neurons (PNs), the inhibitory neuron APL, a pair of extrinsic output neurons, but relatively few mushroom body intrinsic neurons, Kenyon cells; PN terminals carried the OA receptor Oamb, a Drosophila $\alpha$1-adrenergic receptor ortholog. We developed a behavioral assay to distinguish discrimination from learning ability, and showed that optogenetic activation of OA neurons compromised odor discrimination behavior but not learning ability. Our results suggest that OA neurons modify odor representations via multiple extrinsic inputs at the sensory input area to the olfactory learning circuit.},

Under low ATP concentrations, phase separation in the microdomain is reinforced, enhancing kinase activity, and thereby conferring control of a critical cell cycle signaling pathway to the physical properties of the membraneless organelle. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

IDPs are subject to combinatorial post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, adding complexity to regulatory networks and providing a mechanism for tissue-specific signalling. These proteins participate in the assembly of signalling complexes and in the dynamic self-assembly of membrane-less nuclear and cytoplasmic organelles.

abstract = {Recognition of the natural abundance and functional importance of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), and protein hybrids that contain both intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) and ordered regions, is changing protein science. IDPs and IDPRs, i.e., functional proteins and protein regions without unique structures, can often be found in all organisms, and typically play vital roles in various biological processes. Disorder-based functionality complements the functions of ordered proteins and domains. However, by virtue of their existence, IDPs/IDPRs, which are characterized by remarkable conformational flexibility and structural plasticity, break multiple rules established over the years to explain structure, folding, and functionality of well-folded proteins with unique structures. Despite the general belief that unique biological functions of proteins require unique 3D-structures (which dominated protein science for more than a century), structure-less IDPs/IDPRs are functional, being able to engage in biological activities and perform impossible tricks that are highly unlikely for ordered proteins. With their exceptional spatio-temporal heterogeneity and high conformational flexibility, IDPs/IDPRs represent complex systems that act at the edge of chaos and are specifically tunable by various means. In this article, some of the wonders of intrinsic disorder are discussed as illustrations of their "mysterious" (meta)physics.},

abstract = {With today's available computer power, free energy calculations from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations "via counting" become feasible for an increasing number of reactions. An example is the dimerization reaction of transmembrane alpha-helices. If an extended simulation of the two helices covers sufficiently many dimerization and dissociation events, their binding free energy is readily derived from the fraction of time during which the two helices are observed in dimeric form. Exactly how the correct value for the free energy is to be calculated, however, is unclear, and indeed several different and contradictory approaches have been used. In particular, results obtained via Boltzmann statistics differ from those determined via the law of mass action. Here, we develop a theory that resolves this discrepancy. We show that for simulation systems containing two molecules, the dimerization free energy is given by a formula of the form $\Delta$G ∝ ln(P1/P 0). Our theory is also applicable to high concentrations that typically have to be used in molecular dynamics simulations to keep the simulation system small, where the textbook dilute approximations fail. It also covers simulations with an arbitrary number of monomers and dimers and provides rigorous error estimates. Comparison with test simulations of a simple Lennard Jones system with various particle numbers as well as with reference free energy values obtained from radial distribution functions show full agreement for both binding free energies and dimerization statistics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

[Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2009, 11, 1128] have recently proposed that having the ratio of forward and reverse rate constants equal to the equilibrium constant - a relationship they equate with detailed balance - is a sufficient condition to guarantee that a chemical system eventually relaxes to equilibrium. This assertion is true, however, only for an isolated system. In a closed system, where energy exchange between the system and the environment occurs, input of energy in the form of an externally driven oscillation of a thermodynamic parameter (e.g. pressure or electric field strength), can maintain a chemical system in a stationary state away from equilibrium even if the ratio of the forward and backward rate constants for each elementary reaction equals the equilibrium constant at every instant. This fact allows appropriately designed molecules to serve as free-energy transducers and molecular machines. {\textcopyright} 2009 the Owner Societies.},

J. 86:3510-3518) present a method to impose detailed balance on a complex reaction mechanism, which relies on identifying reaction cycles. We propose a method to impose detailed balance without explicitly considering reaction cycles. In our method, the detailed balance constraint is imposed by parameterizing the model in terms of the concentrations and balanced fluxes at equilibrium. A general rate matrix satisfying detailed balance is derived from these parameters. We illustrate this technique for voltage-and ligand-dependent single molecule kinetics. In the single molecule case, when ligand binding obeys the law of mass action, we point out that our parameterization correctly gives the ligand dependence of the equilibrium probabilities without solving any equations. We also show how to impose detailed balance for general nonlinear mass-action kinetics. The techniques for obtaining a minimal reaction network subject to the detailed balance constraint are also presented and illustrated on a large network.},

During the fitting of reaction mechanisms it is therefore often required that cycles in the mechanism should obey microscopic reversibility at all times. In complex reaction mechanisms, especially those that contain cubic arrangements of states, it may not be obvious how to achieve this. Three general methods for imposing microscopic reversibility are described. The first method works by setting the 'obvious' four-state cycles in the correct order. The second method, based on the idea of a spanning tree, works by finding independent cycles (which will often have more than four states) such that the order in which they are set does not matter. The third method uses linear algebra to solve for constrained rates.},

Unfortunately, particularly for long insertions, editing efficiencies can vary widely, necessitating multiple injections, and often requiring co-selection strategies. Here we show that melting double stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor molecules prior to injection increases the frequency of precise homology-directed repair (HDR) by several fold for longer edits. We describe troubleshooting strategies that enable consistently high editing efficiencies resulting, for example, in up to 100 independent GFP knock-ins from a single injected animal. These efficiencies make C. elegans by far the easiest metazoan to genome edit, removing barriers to the use and adoption of this facile system as a model for understanding animal biology.},

abstract = {The $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediates fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain. Although the most N-terminal leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIVBP) domain is suggested to play a role in the initial assembly of iGluR subunits, it is unclear how this domain is arranged and functions in intact iGluRs. Similarly, although recent crystallographic analyses indicate that the isolated ligand-binding lysine/arginine/ornithine-binding protein domain forms a 2-fold symmetric dimer, the subunit stoichiometry of intact iGluRs remains elusive. Here, we developed a new approach to address these issues. The LIVBP domain of the GIuR1 subunit of AMPA receptors was replaced by leucine-zipper peptides designed to form stable symmetric dimers, trimers, tetramers, or pentamers. All these mutant GluR1s were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and were transported to the cell surface as well as wild type GluR1. Functional and biochemical analyses indicated that these oligomerizing peptides specifically controlled the formation of the expected number of subunits in a channel complex. However, the channel function was only restored by the tetramer-forming peptide. Although the purified LIVBP domain of GluR1 formed a dimmer in solution, a dimer-forming peptide could not restore the function of GluR1. Moreover, a cross-linking assay indicated that four LIVBP domains are located in proximity to each other. These results suggest that the function of the LIVBP domain is not simply to form initial dimers but to adopt a conformation compatible with the overall tetrameric arrangement of subunits in intact AMPA receptors. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Members of this large protein family are important regulators of numerous cellular functions including innate immune responses, transcriptional regulation and apoptosis. Key to their cellular role is their E3 ligase activity which is conferred by the RING domain. Self-association is an important characteristic of TRIM protein activity and is mediated by homodimerization via the coiled-coil region, and in some cases higher order association via additional domains of the tripartite motif. In many of the TRIM family proteins studied thus far, RING dimerization is an important prerequisite for E3 ligase enzymatic activity though the propensity of RING domains to dimerize differs significantly between different TRIMs and can be influenced by other regions of the protein.},

The B-Box occupies an E2 binding site on the catalytic RING domain by mimicking E2-E3 interactions, inhibiting TRIM21 ubiquitination and preventing immune activation. TRIM21 is derepressed by IKK$\beta$ and TBK1 phosphorylation of an LxxIS motif in the RING domain, at the interface with the B-Box. Incorporation of phosphoserine or a phosphomimetic within this motif relieves B-Box inhibition, promoting E2 binding, RING catalysis, NF-kB activation and cytokine transcription upon infection with DNA or RNA viruses. These data explain how intracellular antibody signalling is regulated and reveal that the B-Box is a critical regulator of RING E3 ligase activity.},

Positive feedback enables concentration of Rho-GTPases into clusters at the cell cortex, from where they regulate the cytoskeleton. Different cell types reproducibly generate either one (e.g. the front of a migrating cell) or several clusters (e.g. the multiple dendrites of a neuron), but the mechanistic basis for unipolar or multipolar outcomes is unclear. The design principles of Rho-GTPase circuits are captured by two-component reaction-diffusion models based on conserved aspects of Rho-GTPase biochemistry. Some such models display rapid winner-takes-all competition between clusters, yielding a unipolar outcome. Other models allow prolonged co-existence of clusters. We investigate the behavior of a simple class of models and show that while the timescale of competition varies enormously depending on model parameters, a single factor explains a large majority of this variation. The dominant factor concerns the degree to which the maximal active GTPase concentration in a cluster approaches a “saturation point” determined by model parameters. We suggest that both saturation and the effect of saturation on competition reflect fundamental properties of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism, which predict whether the system will generate unipolar or multipolar outcomes.},

abstract = {Caenorhabditis elegans early embryos generate cell-specific transcriptomes despite lacking active transcription, thereby presenting an opportunity to study mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulatory control. We observed that some cell-specific mRNAs accumulate non-homogenously within cells, localizing to membranes, P granules (associated with progenitor germ cells in the P lineage) and P-bodies (associated with RNA processing). The subcellular distribution of transcripts differed in their dependence on 3′UTRs and RNA binding proteins, suggesting diverse regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we found strong but imperfect correlations between low translational status and P granule localization within the progenitor germ lineage. By uncoupling translation from mRNA localization, we untangled a long-standing question: Are mRNAs directed to P granules to be translationally repressed, or do they accumulate there as a consequence of this repression? We found that translational repression preceded P granule localization and could occur independently of it. Further, disruption of translation was sufficient to send homogenously distributed mRNAs to P granules. These results implicate transcriptional repression as a means to deliver essential maternal transcripts to the progenitor germ lineage for later translation.},

abstract = {Asymmetric cell division is one of the most elegant biological systems by which cells create daughter cells with different functions and increase cell diversity. In particular, PAR polarity in the cell membrane plays a critical role in regulating the whole process of asymmetric cell division. Numerous studies have been conducted to determine the underlying mechanism of PAR polarity formation using both experimental and theoretical approaches in the last 10 years. However, they have mostly focused on answering the fundamental question of how this exclusive polarity is established but the precise dynamics of polarity domain have been little notified. In this review, I focused on studies on the shape, length, and location of PAR polarity from a theoretical perspective that may be important for an integrated understanding of the entire process of asymmetric cell division.},

They are characterised by a conserved N-terminal tripartite motif comprising a RING, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, with C-terminal domains often mediating substrate recruitment. TRIM proteins are grouped into 11 classes based on C-terminal domain identity. Class VI TRIMs, TRIM24, TRIM33, and TRIM28, have been described as transcriptional regulators, a function linked to their C-terminal plant homeodomain and bromodomain, and independent of their ubiquitination activity. It is unclear whether E3 ligase activity is regulated in family members where the C-terminal domains function independently. Here, we provide a detailed biochemical characterisation of the RING domains of class VI TRIMs and describe the solution structure of the TRIM28 RING. Our study reveals a lack of activity of the isolated RING domains, which may be linked to the absence of self-association. We propose that class VI TRIMs exist in an inactive state and require additional regulatory events to stimulate E3 ligase activity, ensuring that associated chromatin-remodelling factors are not injudiciously degraded.},

abstract = {The motion of nanoparticles near surfaces is of fundamental importance in physics, biology, and chemistry. Liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) is a promising technique for studying motion of nanoparticles with high spatial resolution. Yet, the lack of understanding of how the electron beam of the microscope affects the particle motion has held back advancement in using LCTEM for in situ single nanoparticle and macromolecule tracking at interfaces. Here, we experimentally studied the motion of a model system of gold nanoparticles dispersed in water and moving adjacent to the silicon nitride membrane of a commercial liquid cell in a broad range of electron beam dose rates. We find that the nanoparticles exhibit anomalous diffusive behavior modulated by the electron beam dose rate. We characterized the anomalous diffusion of nanoparticles in LCTEM using a convolutional deep neural network model and canon-ical statistical tests. The results demonstrate that the nanoparticle motion is governed by fractional Brownian motion at low dose rates, resembling diffusion in a viscoelastic medium, and continuous time random walk at high dose rates, resembling diffusion on an energy landscape with pinning sites. Both behaviors can be explained by the presence of silanol molecular species on the surface of the silicon nitride membrane and the ionic species in solution formed by radiolysis of water in presence of the electron beam.

RESULTS: The C. elegans genome encodes 20 UBCs and three ubiquitin E2 variant proteins. RNAi shows that only four UBCs are essential for embryogenesis: LET-70 (UBC-2), a functional homolog of yeast Ubc4/5p, UBC-9, an ortholog of yeast Ubc9p, which transfers the ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO, UBC-12, an ortholog of yeast Ubc12p, which transfers the ubiquitin-like modifier Rub1/Nedd8, and UBC-14, an ortholog of Drosophila Courtless. RNAi of ubc-20, an ortholog of yeast UBC1, results in a low frequency of arrested larval development. A phylogenetic analysis of C. elegans, Drosophila and human UBCs shows that this protein family can be divided into 18 groups, 13 of which include members from all three species. The activating enzymes and the ubiquitin-like proteins NED-8 and SUMO are required for embryogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The number of UBC genes appears to increase with developmental complexity, and our results suggest functional overlap in many of these enzymes. The ubiquitin-like proteins NED-8 and SUMO and their corresponding activating enzymes are required for embryogenesis.},

abstract = {? 2016 Francis Crick Institute. Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.TRIM E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate a wide variety of cellular processes and are particularly important during innate immune signalling events. They are characterized by a conserved tripartite motif in their N-terminal portion which comprises a canonical RING domain, one or two B-box domains and a coiled-coil region that mediates ligase dimerization. Self-association via the coiled-coil has been suggested to be crucial for catalytic activity of TRIMs; however, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this observation remains elusive. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of the TRIM ligases TRIM25 and TRIM32 and show how their oligomeric state is linked to catalytic activity. The crystal structure of a complex between the TRIM25 RING domain and an ubiquitin-loaded E2 identifies the structural and mechanistic features that promote a closed E2$\sim$Ub conformation to activate the thioester for ubiquitin transfer allowing us to propose a model for the regulation of activity in the full-length protein. Our data reveal an unexpected diversity in the self-association mechanism of TRIMs that might be crucial for their biological function. Synopsis TRIM proteins are oligomeric E3 ligases that require RING dimerization for catalytic activity. Structural and biochemical data reveal diverse mechanisms mediating RING dimerization, which can occur in an intra- or intermolecular manner. RING dimerization of TRIM25 and TRIM32 is crucial for catalytic activity and is mediated by helices N- and C-terminal to the core RING domain. The RING domain of TRIM32 is a constitutive dimer, while the RING domain of TRIM25 has a very low propensity for self-association. TRIM32 exists as a tetramer formed by two independent dimerization modules, the coiled-coil region and the RING domains. RING25 is a coiled-coil-mediated dimer, and RING dimerization likely occurs in an intramolecular fashion. A conserved acidic residue outside the core RING domain of TRIM ligases is important for catalytic activity. Structural and biochemical characterization of oligomeric ubiquitin ligases TRIM25 and TRIM32 shows diverse mechanisms mediating RING dimerization, which can occur in an intra- or intermolecular manner.},

However, the cellular intrinsic cue underlying the binary choice between these two division modes remains elusive. Here we show evidence in Caenorhabditis elegans that the invariable lineage of the division modes is programmed by the balance between antagonizing complexes of partitioning-defective (PAR) proteins. By uncoupling unequal inheritance of PAR proteins from that of fate determinants during zygote division, we demonstrated that changes in the balance between PAR-2 and PAR-6 are sufficient to re-program the division modes from symmetric to asymmetric and vice versa in two-cell stage embryos. The division mode adopted occurs independently of asymmetry in cytoplasmic fate determinants, cell-size asymmetry, and cell-cycle asynchrony between the sister cells. We propose that the balance between antagonizing PAR proteins represents an intrinsic self-organizing cue for binary specification of the division modes during development.},

abstract = {Time series classification (TSC) is the area of machine learning interested in learning how to assign labels to time series. The last few decades of work in this area have led to significant progress in the accuracy of classifiers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE is infeasible to use in many applications because of its very high training time complexity in O(N^2*T^4) for a dataset with N time series of length T. For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 72,000s to learn from a small dataset with N=700 time series of short length T=46. Deep learning, on the other hand, has now received enormous attention because of its high scalability and state-of-the-art accuracy in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Deep learning for TSC has only very recently started to be explored, with the first few architectures developed over the last 3 years only. The accuracy of deep learning for TSC has been raised to a competitive level, but has not quite reached the level of HIVE-COTE. This is what this paper achieves: outperforming HIVE-COTE's accuracy together with scalability. We take an important step towards finding the AlexNet network for TSC by presenting InceptionTime---an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime slightly outperforms HIVE-COTE with a win/draw/loss on the UCR archive of 40/6/39. Not only is InceptionTime more accurate, but it is much faster: InceptionTime learns from that same dataset with 700 time series in 2,300s but can also learn from a dataset with 8M time series in 13 hours, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.},

Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

Three key components of the pathway are required for ubiquitination to occur: the E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme, the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase. There are several different E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and an even greater number of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Interactions between these two groups are critical for substrate ubiquitination. This study reports a two-hybrid analysis of interactions within the ubiquitin system of Caenorhabditis elegans. Forty-three RING finger proteins (presumed E3 ubiquitin ligases) and 14 predicted E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes were included in the screen. A total of 31 E2-E3 interactions were uncovered. In addition, the UBC-13 conjugating enzyme was observed to interact with two different E2s, UEV-1 and UBC-1. The interaction of UBC-1 and UBC-13 was confirmed with in vitro ubiquitination reactions. Using NHL-1 as the E3 in the assays, ubiquitination was observed when both UBC-1 and UBC-13 were present but not with either alone.

abstract = {The par-2 gene of Caenorhabditi elgans functions in early embryogenesis to ensure an amme first cleavage and the segregation of cytoplasmic factors. Both processes appear to be required to generate daughter blas-tomeres with distinct developmental potential. We isolated an allele of par-2 by using a screen for maternal-effect lethal mutations in a strain known for its high frequency of transposition events. A transposable lement was found to be linked to this allele. Sequences lanig the site oftransposon insertion were cloned and found to rescue the par-2 mutant phenotype. DNA In the par-2 region hybridized to a 2.3-kb germ-liue-enriched mRNA. The cDNA corresponding to this germ-line-enriched message was cloned, sequenced, and used to identify the molecular lesions associated with three par-2 alleles. Sequence analysis of the par-2 cDNA revealed that the predicted protein contained two distinct motifs found in other known proteins: an ATP-binding site and a cystelue-rich motif which identifies thepar-2 gene product as a member of a growing class of putative zinc-binding proteins. A class of genes has been identified that is required for the generation of asymmetry in the early embryo and whose mutant phenotype resembles the cytochalasin D-treated embryos described above (6). Mutations in any one of the five par genes (for partitioning-defective) result in embryos with defects in the pition of the first cleavage furrow, altered orientation of the spindle at the second cleavage, synchronous early cleavages, defects in P-granule localization, and altered expression of intestinal cell differentiation markers. All mutations in these five genes result in strict maternal-effect lethality; therefore maternal expression of the par genes is required during oogenesis in order to produce viable embryos. To gain further insight into the role of the par genes in cytoplasmic partitioning, molecular analysis ofthese genes is essential. As a step toward an understanding of the generation of asymmetry and cytoplasmic localization in the C. elegans embryo at the molecular level, we have isolated and sequenced the par-2 gene. 1 1 Early embryogenesis in the nematode Caenorhabditis ele-gans is characterized by a series of asymmetric cleavages. The initial asymmetry of the early embryo becomes apparent during the first cell cycle, at which time cytoplasmic factors thought to be required for the specification of cell fate are segregated. The first cleavage produces a larger, anterior cell (AB) and a smaller, posterior cell (P1) which differ from each other in many respects including the orientation of subsequent cleavage planes, the timing ofcell cycles, and the kinds of differentiated cell types they ultimately produce (1). For instance, germ-line-specific P granules are uniformly dispersed in one-cell embryos but become localized to the posterior cortex midway through the first cell cycle (2). At first cleavage, nearly all of the P granules are partitioned to the P1 blastomere. Furthermore, studies of gut development (3) have shown that factors required for specification of the intestine are present in P1, and not AB, at the two-cell stage. Blastomere fusion experiments have shown that these factors can be found in the cytoplasm of P1 (4). The nature of the cytoplasmic mechanisms that generate asymmetry in the one-cell embryo are unknown, but micro-filaments play a significant role in this process. Many of the manifestations of asymmetry in the early embryo can be disrupted by treatment of embryos with cytochalasin D (5). Treated one-cell embryos typically divide symmetrically and have mislocalized P granules; subsequent cleavage patterns are also abnormal. Presumably, disorganization of the mi-crofilament system between fertilization and pronuclear fusion affects the segregation of factors that govern embryo polarity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Genetics. Nematode strains were maintained according to Brenner (7). The strain for identification of a transposon-induced allele of par-2 was constructed by crossing egl-23(n601) into the mutator strain TR679. Mutator strains in C. elegans undergo a high rate of transposition. The mutator activity in TR679, mut-2(r459), can be balanced by the chromosomal rearrangement mnCl (8). Homozygous egl-23(n601);mut-2(r459) animals were derived from the hetero-zygous strain egl-23(n601)/+;mnCl/mut-2(r459). These egl-23(n601);mut-2(r459) animals were the starting strain for the screen for maternal-effect lethal mutations. The screen was performed as described by Kemphues et al. (6). Embryos from candidate strains bearing maternal-effect lethal mutations were examined by Nomarski microscopy and assigned to a linkage group. One mutation identified in this screen, jb2, mapped to LGIII. Eggs from homozygous jb2 mothers exhibited synchronous and symmetric early cleavages. Since mutations in a known gene (par-2; see ref. 6) on LGIII result in a similar phenotype, complementation tests were performed betweenjb2 and par-2(itSts). jb2 failed to complement par-2(itSts).

abstract = {The development and differentiation of complex organisms from the single fertilized egg is regulated by a variety of processes that all rely on the distribution and interaction of proteins. Despite the tight regulation of these processes with respect to temporal and spatial protein localization, exact quantification of the underlying parameters, such as concentrations and distribution coefficients, has so far been problematic. Recent experiments suggest that fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on a single molecule level in living cells has great promise in revealing these parameters with high precision. The optically challenging situation in multicellular systems such as embryos can be ameliorated by two-photon excitation, where scattering background and cumulative photobleaching is limited. A more severe problem is posed by the large range of molecular mobilities observed at the same time, as standard FCS relies strongly on the presence of mobility-induced fluctuations. In this study, we overcame the limitations of standard FCS. We analyzed in vivo polarity protein PAR-2 from eggs of Caenorhabditis elegans by beam-scanning FCS in the cytosol and on the cortex of C. elegans before asymmetric cell division. The surprising result is that the distribution of PAR-2 is largely uncoupled from the movement of cytoskeletal components of the cortex. These results call for a more systematic future investigation of the different cortical elements, and show that the FCS technique can contribute to answering these questions, by providing a complementary approach that can reveal insights not obtainable by other techniques. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

Often, this task is strongly impacted by data consisting of trajectories with short length and limited localization precision. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method based on a random forest architecture, which is able to associate even very short trajectories to the underlying diffusion mechanism with a high accuracy. In addition, the method is able to classify the motion according to normal or anomalous diffusion, and determine its anomalous exponent with a small error. The method provides highly accurate outputs even when working with very short trajectories and in the presence of experimental noise. We further demonstrate the application of transfer learning to experimental and simulated data not included in the training/testing dataset. This allows for a full, high-accuracy characterization of experimental trajectories without the need of any prior information.},

We used a combination of pharmacological and chemical genetic approaches to probe the function of PM PI4P, most of which was not required for the synthesis or functions of PI(4,5)P2. However, depletion of both lipids was required to prevent PM targeting of proteins that interact with acidic lipids or activation of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 cation channel. Therefore, PI4P contributes to the pool of polyanionic lipids that define plasma membrane identity and to some functions previously attributed specifically to PI(4,5)P2, which may be fulfilled by a more general polyanionic lipid requirement.},

abstract = {The tumor-suppressor protein BRCA1 works with BARD1 to catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin onto protein substrates. The N-terminal regions of BRCA1 and BARD1 that contain their RING domains are responsible for dimerization and ubiquitin ligase activity. This activity is a common feature among hundreds of human RING domain-containing proteins. RING domains bind and activate E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to promote ubiquitin transfer to substrates. We show that the identity of residues at specific positions in the RING domain can tune activity levels up or down. We report substitutions that create a structurally intact BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer that is inactive in vitro with all E2 enzymes. Other substitutions in BRCA1 or BARD1 RING domains result in hyperactivity, revealing that both proteins have evolved attenuated activity. Loss of attenuation results in decreased product specificity, providing a rationale for why nature has tuned BRCA1 activity. The ability to tune BRCA1 provides powerful tools for understanding its biological functions and provides a basis to assess mechanisms for rescuing the activity of cancer-associated variations. Beyond the applicability to BRCA1, we show the identity of residues at tuning positions that can be used to predict and modulate the activity of an unrelated RING E3 ligase. These findings provide valuable insights into understanding the mechanism and function of RING E3 ligases like BRCA1.},

The model and additional analyses reveal that E3 binding biases dynamic E2∼Ub ensembles toward closed conformations with enhanced reactivity for substrate lysines. We identify a key hydrogen bond between a highly conserved E3 side chain and an E2 backbone carbonyl, observed in all structures of active RING/U-Box E3/E2 pairs, as the linchpin for allosteric activation of E2∼Ub. The conformational biasing mechanism is generalizable across diverse E2s and RING/U-box E3s, but is not shared by HECT-type E3s.

abstract = {Anomalous diffusion occurs in many physical and biological phenomena, when the growth of the mean squared displacement (MSD) with time has an exponent different from one. We show that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can efficiently characterize anomalous diffusion by determining the exponent from a single short trajectory, outperforming the standard estimation based on the MSD when the available data points are limited, as is often the case in experiments. Furthermore, the RNNs can handle more complex tasks where there are no standard approaches, such as determining the anomalous diffusion exponent from a trajectory sampled at irregular times, and estimating the switching time and anomalous diffusion exponents of an intermittent system that switches between different kinds of anomalous diffusion. We validate our method on experimental data obtained from subdiffusive colloids trapped in speckle light fields and superdiffusive microswimmers. Anomalous diffusion underlies various physical and biological systems, such as the motion of microscopic particles in a crowded subcellular environment and the active dynamics of biomolecules in the cytoplasm [1-3]. While normal diffusion is characterized by a linear growth of the mean squared displacement (MSD) with time, anomalous diffusion features a nonlinear, power-law growth. If we consider a microscopic particle whose position is X (t), its MSD is, in the stationary case, E [(X (t + $\tau$) − X (t)) 2 ] = K $\alpha$ $\tau$ $\alpha$ , (1) where $\alpha$ is the exponent characterizing the anomalous diffusion and K $\alpha$ is a generalized diffusion coefficient with dimension [length 2 time −$\alpha$ ]. The exponent $\alpha$ contains crucial information regarding the nature of these systems distinguishing standard diffusion ($\alpha$ = 1) from anomalous diffusion ($\alpha$ < 1 for subdiffusion and $\alpha$ > 1 for superdiffusion). Therefore, it is crucial to be able to determine its value from experimental data. When large datasets are available, the exponent can be straightforwardly fitted from the empirical MSD [4-8], or using alternative techniques [9-15]. Most of these methods work under the assumption that the exponent does not change abruptly over the duration of the measurement, and require the particles' trajectory to be sufficiently long and to be sampled at regular time intervals (unless several trajectories are available for each case). However, especially in single-molecule studies and in nonequilibrium experiments, the dynamic and unsteady character of the process under study and the variability of the environment restrict the possibility to collect large amounts of data under the exact same conditions [16]. Therefore, often one has only access to trajectories that are short (e.g., limited * Present address:},

However, how the Par complex is concentrated beneath the membrane to initiate cell polarization remains unclear. Here we show that the Par complex exhibits cell cycle-dependent condensation in Drosophila neuroblasts, driven by liquid–liquid phase separation. The open conformation of Par3 undergoes autonomous phase separation likely due to its NTD-mediated oligomerization. Par6, via C-terminal tail binding to Par3 PDZ3, can be enriched to Par3 condensates and in return dramatically promote Par3 phase separation. aPKC can also be concentrated to the Par3N/Par6 condensates as a client. Interestingly, activated aPKC can disperse the Par3/Par6 condensates via phosphorylation of Par3. Perturbations of Par3/Par6 phase separation impair the establishment of apical–basal polarity during neuroblast asymmetric divisions and lead to defective lineage development. We propose that phase separation may be a common mechanism for localized cortical condensation of cell polarity complexes.},

Inferring the character of their dynamics is important, because it determines the organization and functions of the cells. For this reason, one of the first steps in the analysis of SPT data is the identification of the diffusion type of the observed particles. The most popular method to identify the class of a trajectory is based on the mean square displacement (MSD). However, due to its known limitations, several other approaches have been already proposed. With the recent advances in algorithms and the developments of modern hardware, the classification attempts rooted in machine learning (ML) are of particular interest. In this work, we adopt two ML ensemble algorithms, i.e. random forest and gradient boosting, to the problem of trajectory classification. We present a new set of features used to transform the raw trajectories data into input vectors required by the classifiers. The resulting models are then applied to real data for G protein-coupled receptors and G proteins. The classification results are compared to recent statistical methods going beyond MSD.},

We compare this fully automated approach working with raw data to classical machine learning techniques that require data preprocessing and extraction of human-engineered features from the trajectories to feed classifiers like random forest or gradient boosting. All methods are tested using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical model is known. From the results it follows that CNN is usually slightly better than the feature-based methods, but at the cost of much longer processing times.

We demonstrate that ImaEdge enables efficient and rigorous analysis of the dynamic evolution of cortical PAR proteins during Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis.

The algorithm first links particles between consecutive frames and then links the resulting track segments into complete trajectories. Both steps are formulated as global combinatorial optimization problems whose solution identifies the overall most likely set of particle trajectories throughout a movie. Using this approach, we show that the GTPase dynamin differentially affects the kinetics of long- and short-lived endocytic structures and that the motion of CD36 receptors along cytoskeleton-mediated linear tracks increases their aggregation probability. Both applications indicate the requirement for robust and complete tracking of dense particle fields to dissect the mechanisms of receptor organization at the level of the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {The fidelity of the trajectories obtained from video-based particle tracking determines the success of a variety of biophysical techniques, including in situ single cell particle tracking and in vitro motility assays. However, the image acquisition process is complicated by system noise, which causes positioning error in the trajectories derived from image analysis. Here, we explore the possibility of reducing the positioning error by the application of a Kalman filter, a powerful algorithm to estimate the state of a linear dynamic system from noisy measurements. We show that the optimal Kalman filter parameters can be determined in an appropriate experimental setting, and that the Kalman filter can markedly reduce the positioning error while retaining the intrinsic fluctuations of the dynamic process. We believe the Kalman filter can potentially serve as a powerful tool to infer a trajectory of ultra-high fidelity from noisy images, revealing the details of dynamic cellular processes. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {In the one-cell C. elegans embryo, polarity is maintained by mutual antagonism between the anterior cortical proteins PAR-3, PKC- 3, PAR-6 and CDC-42, and the posterior cortical proteins PAR-2 and LGL-1 on the posterior cortex. The mechanisms by which these proteins interact to maintain polarity are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate the interplay among PAR-2, LGL-1, myosin, the anterior PAR proteins and CDC-42. We find that PAR-2 and LGL-1 affect cortical myosin accumulation by different mechanisms. LGL-1 does not directly antagonize the accumulation of cortical myosin and instead plays a role in regulating PAR-6 levels. By contrast, PAR-2 likely has separate roles in regulating cortical myosin accumulation and preventing the expansion of the anterior cortical domain. We also provide evidence that asymmetry of active CDC-42 can be maintained independently of LGL-1 and PAR-2 by a redundant pathway that includes the CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1. Finally, we show that, in addition to its primary role in regulating the size of the anterior cortical domain via its binding to PAR-6, CDC-42 has a secondary role in regulating cortical myosin that is not dependent on PAR-6. {\textcopyright} 2013.

Highly specific interactions between ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) and ubiquitin protein E3 ligases fulfil essential roles in this process. We performed a global yeast-two hybrid screen to study the specificity of interactions between catalytic domains of the 35 human E2s with 250 RING-type E3s. Our analysis showed over 300 high-quality interactions, uncovering a large fraction of new E2-E3 pairs. Both within the E2 and the E3 cohorts, several members were identified that are more versatile in their interaction behaviour than others. We also found that the physical interactions of our screen compare well with reported functional E2-E3 pairs in in vitro ubiquitination experiments. For validation we confirmed the interaction of several versatile E2s with E3s in in vitro protein interaction assays and we used mutagenesis to alter the E3 interactions of the E2 specific for K63 linkages, UBE2N(Ubc13), towards the K48-specific UBE2D2(UbcH5B).

abstract = {state intermediate 15 , and an aspartate side chain may suppress the pK a of lysine on a substrate 16. These findings have led to the proposal that RING E3 binding may organize the E2's active site through allosteric effects to enhance substrate ubiquitination 8,9. Several RING E3s must homo-or heterodimerize to form active ligases. For example, RAD18, RNF4, TRAF6, IDOL and the baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing protein (BIRC) family of RING E3s form homodimers, whereas others, like MDM2, BRCA1 and RNF2, heterodi-merize with inactive RING domains, namely MDMX, BARD1 and BMI1, respectively (reviewed in ref. 13). Although the structures of dimeric RINGs differ slightly, dimerization is achieved by RING-RING interactions and by residues flanking the N-and C-terminal regions of the RING domain. Mutations that disrupt RING dimerization reduce ubiquitination activity 17-20. Recent studies on BIRC-family RING E3s and RNF4 showed that RING dimerization is required for E2$\sim$Ub binding 18,21. For RNF4, one subunit of the RING domain dimer is proposed to bind E2 and the C-terminal tail of the second subunit to interact with the Ile44 surface of the corresponding donor Ub to facilitate Ub transfer 18. The importance of the C-terminal tail of the RING dimer is supported by a previous study on MDM2-MDMX, where inactive MDM2 C-terminal tail mutants were rescued by heterodimerization with wild-type MDMX 22. Several models describing how RING E3s promote Ub transfer have been proposed on the basis of a wealth of biochemical data, but there is currently no available structure of a RING E3-E2$\sim$Ub complex. BIRC proteins play a major part as negative regulators of cell death, and several members of this protein family, including BIRC2 and BIRC3, contain a C-terminal RING domain that homodimerizes to form an active E3 (refs. 17,21). The E3 activity is required for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of critical apoptotic-pathway components, Post-translational modification by Ub is an important regulatory mechanism for a wide variety of cellular processes 1,2. Ub is activated and conjugated to substrate by the consecutive actions of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), an E2 and an E3 (ref. 1). E1 activates and forms a covalent thioester intermediate with the C terminus of Ub in an ATP-dependent manner. Ub is then transferred to E2, resulting in a covalent thioester linkage between E2's catalytic cysteine and Ub's C terminus (E2$\sim$Ub). E3s promote transfer of Ub from E2 to the amino group of a substrate lysine and generally contain E2 and substrate-binding domains to facilitate this process. Several classes of E3s have been defined based on the mechanism of transfer: HECT, RING, U-box and RING-in-between-RING 3,4. For RING E3s, the largest class 5 , Ub is transferred directly from E2$\sim$Ub to substrate without the formation of a covalent E3$\sim$Ub intermediate. How RING E3s promote Ub transfer is unclear. In the absence of an E3, E2$\sim$Ub is able to catalyze the transfer of donor Ub (conjugated Ub) to an acceptor Ub, free amine or substrate 4,6-11 , but addition of a RING E3 massively enhances the rate 4,8,9,11. In several structures of RING E3-E2 complexes, the RING domain binds E2 at a region distal to the E2's active site, precluding direct modification of the active site by the RING E3 (refs. 12,13). Only biochemical analyses provide some insight into how RING E3s promote Ub transfer. Recent studies have shown that interactions between the Ile44 surface of the donor Ub and E2 a3's residues are important for donor Ub transfer in the absence and presence of RING E3s 9,10. Notably, mutations on the surface of the E2 UbcH5B, which are distal from both the RING domain-binding site and active site, influence the ability of RING E3s to stimulate Ub transfer 8,14. In addition, mutational analyses of several E2s have identified highly conserved key residues near E2's active site that are critical for catalysis: an asparagine side chain may stabilize the oxyanion transition BIRC7-E2 ubiquitin conjugate structure reveals the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer by a RING dimer certain ring ubiquitin ligases (e3s) dimerize to facilitate ubiquitin (ub) transfer from ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2) to substrate, but structural evidence on how this process promotes ub transfer is lacking. Here we report the structure of the human dimeric ring domain from birc7 in complex with the e2 ubcH5b covalently linked to ub (ubcH5b$\sim$ub). the structure reveals extensive noncovalent donor ub interactions with ubcH5b and both subunits of the ring domain dimer that stabilize the globular body and c-terminal tail of ub. mutations that disrupt these noncovalent interactions or ring dimerization reduce ubcH5b$\sim$ub binding affinity and ubiquitination activity. moreover, nmr analyses demonstrate that birc7 binding to ubcH5b$\sim$ub induces peak-shift perturbations in the donor ub consistent with the crystallographically-observed ub interactions. our results provide structural insights into how dimeric ring e3s recruit e2$\sim$ub and optimize the donor ub configuration for transfer.},

abstract = {In the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, astral microtubules generate forces, pushing against and pulling from the cell periphery. They are essential to position the mitotic spindle and in turn the cytokinesis furrow, ensuring the proper distribution of fate determinants to the daughter cells. By measuring the dynamics of astral microtubules, we revealed the presence of two populations, residing at the cortex during 0.4 s and 1.8 s, proposed to reflect the pulling and pushing events, respectively. This is a unique opportunity to unravel the time and space variations of these both spindle-positioning forces, to study their regulation under physiological conditions. By an investigation at the microscopic level, we first confirmed that the asymmetry in pulling forces was encoded by an anteroposterior imbalance in dynein-engaging rate, and that this asymmetry exists from early metaphase on and accounts for the final spindle position. More importantly, we obtained direct proof of the temporal control of pulling forces through the force-generator processivity increase during anaphase. Lastly, we discovered an anti-correlation between the long-lived population density and the stability of the spindle position during metaphase, which strongly suggests that the pushing forces contribute to maintaining the spindle at the cell centre.},

It is often difficult to detect bistability based on such molecular mechanisms due to its intricate interaction with cellular growth. We constructed transcriptional feedback loops in yeast. To eliminate growth alterations, we reduced the protein levels of the transcription factors by tuning the translation rates over two orders of magnitude with designed RNA stem loops. We modulated two ultrasensitive reactions, homodimerization and the cooperative binding of the transcription factor to the promoter. Either of them is sufficient to generate bistability on its own, and when acting together, a particularly robust bistability emerges. This bistability persists even in the presence of a negative feedback loop. Given that protein homodimerization is ubiquitous, it is likely to play a major role in the behavior of regulatory networks.},

abstract = {Cell polarity is a general cellular process that can be seen in various cell types such as migrating neutrophils and Dictyostelium cells. The Rho small GTP(guanosine 5′-tri phosphate)ases have been shown to regulate cell polarity; however, its mechanism of emergence has yet to be clarified. We first developed a reaction-diffusion model of the Rho GTPases, which exhibits switch-like reversible response to a gradient of extracellular signals, exclusive accumulation of Cdc42 and Rac, or RhoA at the maximal or minimal intensity of the signal, respectively, and tracking of changes of a signal gradient by the polarized peak. The previous cell polarity models proposed by Subramanian and Narang show similar behaviors to our Rho GTPase model, despite the difference in molecular networks. This led us to compare these models, and we found that these models commonly share instability and a mass conservation of components. Based on these common properties, we developed conceptual models of a mass conserved reaction-diffusion system with diffusion-driven instability. These conceptual models retained similar behaviors of cell polarity in the Rho GTPase model. Using these models, we numerically and analytically found that multiple polarized peaks are unstable, resulting in a single stable peak (uniqueness of axis), and that sensitivity toward changes of a signal gradient is specifically restricted at the polarized peak (localized sensitivity). Although molecular networks may differ from one cell type to another, the behaviors of cell polarity in migrating cells seem similar, suggesting that there should be a fundamental principle. Thus, we propose that a mass conserved reaction-diffusion system with diffusion-driven instability is one of such principles of cell polarity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Otsuji et al.},

abstract = {Polarity is essential for generating cell diversity. The one-cell C. elegans embryo serves as a model for studying the establishment and maintenance of polarity. In the early embryo, a myosin II-dependent contraction of the cortical meshwork asymmetrically distributes the highly conserved PDZ proteins PAR-3 and PAR-6, as well as an atypical protein kinase C (PKC-3), to the anterior. The RING-finger protein PAR-2 becomes enriched on the posterior cortex and prevents these three proteins from returning to the posterior. In addition to the PAR proteins, other proteins are required for polarity in many metazoans. One example is the conserved Drosophila tumor-suppressor protein Lethal giant larvae (Lgl). In Drosophila and mammals, Lgl contributes to the maintenance of cell polarity and plays a role in asymmetric cell division. We have found that the C. elegans homolog of Lgl, LGL-1, has a role in polarity but is not essential. It localizes asymmetrically to the posterior of the early embryo in a PKC-3-dependent manner, and functions redundantly with PAR-2 to maintain polarity. Furthermore, overexpression of LGL-1 is sufficient to rescue loss of PAR-2 function. LGL-1 negatively regulates the accumulation of myosin (NMY-2) on the posterior cortex, representing a possible mechanism by which LGL-1 might contribute to polarity maintenance.},

However, a limitation of this system has been the impermeability of the embryo eggshell, which has prevented the routine use of small molecule inhibitors. Here, we present a method to permeabilize and immobilize embryos for acute inhibitor treatment in conjunction with live imaging. To identify a means to permeabilize the eggshell, we used a dye uptake assay to screen a set of 310 candidate genes defined by a combination of bioinformatic criteria. This screen identified 20 genes whose inhibition resulted in .75% eggshell permeability, and 3 that permeabilized embryos with minimal deleterious effects on embryo production and early embryonic development. To mount permeabilized embryos for acute drug addition in conjunction with live imaging, we combined optimized inhibition of one of these genes with the use of a microfabricated chamber that we designed. We demonstrate that these two developments enable the temporally controlled introduction of inhibitors for mechanistic studies. This method should also open new avenues of investigation by allowing profiling and specificity-testing of inhibitors through comparison with genome-wide phenotypic datasets.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that a deep neural network can be trained to virtually refocus a two-dimensional fluorescence image onto user-defined three-dimensional (3D) surfaces within the sample. Using this method, termed Deep-Z, we imaged the neuronal activity of a Caenorhabditis elegans worm in 3D using a time sequence of fluorescence images acquired at a single focal plane, digitally increasing the depth-of-field by 20-fold without any axial scanning, additional hardware or a trade-off of imaging resolution and speed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this approach can correct for sample drift, tilt and other aberrations, all digitally performed after the acquisition of a single fluorescence image. This framework also cross-connects different imaging modalities to each other, enabling 3D refocusing of a single wide-field fluorescence image to match confocal microscopy images acquired at different sample planes. Deep-Z has the potential to improve volumetric imaging speed while reducing challenges relating to sample drift, aberration and defocusing that are associated with standard 3D fluorescence microscopy.},

abstract = {Par-3 regulates animal cell polarity by targeting the Par complex proteins Par-6 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) to specific cortical sites. Although numerous physical interactions between Par-3 and the Par complex have been identified [1–6], we discovered a novel interaction between Par-3's second PDZ domain and a highly conserved aPKC PDZ-binding motif (PBM) that is required in the context of the full-length, purified Par-6-aPKC complex. We also found that Par-3 is phosphorylated by the full Par complex and phosphorylation induces dissociation of the Par-3 phosphorylation site from aPKC's kinase domain but does not disrupt the Par-3 PDZ2-aPKC PBM interaction. In asymmetrically dividing Drosophila neuroblasts, the aPKC PBM is required for cortical targeting, consistent with its role in mediating a persistent interaction with Par-3. Our results define a physical connection that targets the Par complex to polarized sites on the cell membrane.},

abstract = {The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a conserved mitotic regulator that preserves genome stability by monitoring kinetochore-microtubule attachments and blocking anaphase onset until chromosome biorientation is achieved. Despite its central role in maintaining mitotic fidelity, the ability of the SAC to delay mitotic exit in the presence of kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects (SAC "strength") appears to vary widely. How different cellular aspects drive this variation remains largely unknown. Here we show that SAC strength is correlated with cell fate during development of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, with germline-fated cells experiencing longer mitotic delays upon spindle perturbation than somatic cells. These differences are entirely dependent on an intact checkpoint and only partially attributable to differences in cell size. In two-cell embryos, cell size accounts for half of the difference in SAC strength between the larger somatic AB and the smaller germline P 1 blastomeres. The remaining difference requires asymmetric cytoplasmic partitioning downstream of PAR polarity proteins, suggesting that checkpoint-regulating factors are distributed asymmetrically during early germ cell divisions. Our results indicate that SAC activity is linked to cell fate and reveal a hitherto unknown interaction between asymmetric cell division and the SAC.},

abstract = {The field of image denoising is currently dominated by discriminative deep learning methods that are trained on pairs of noisy input and clean target images. Recently it has been shown that such methods can also be trained without clean targets. Instead, independent pairs of noisy images can be used, in an approach known as NOISE2NOISE (N2N). Here, we introduce NOISE2VOID (N2V), a training scheme that takes this idea one step further. It does not require noisy image pairs, nor clean target images. Consequently, N2V allows us to train directly on the body of data to be denoised and can therefore be applied when other methods cannot. Especially interesting is the application to biomedical image data, where the acquisition of training targets, clean or noisy, is frequently not possible. We compare the performance of N2V to approaches that have either clean target images and/or noisy image pairs available. Intuitively, N2V cannot be expected to outperform methods that have more information available during training. Still, we observe that the denois-ing performance of NOISE2VOID drops in moderation and compares favorably to training-free denoising methods.},

abstract = {Diffusion plays a crucial role in many biological processes including signaling, cellular organization, transport mechanisms, and more. Direct observation of molecular movement by single-particle-tracking experiments has contributed to a growing body of evidence that many cellular systems do not exhibit classical Brownian motion but rather anomalous diffusion. Despite this evidence, characterization of the physical process underlying anomalous diffusion remains a challenging problem for several reasons. First, different physical processes can exist simultaneously in a system. Second, commonly used tools for distinguishing between these processes are based on asymptotic behavior, which is experimentally inaccessible in most cases. Finally, an accurate analysis of the diffusion model requires the calculation of many observables because different transport modes can result in the same diffusion power-law $\alpha$, which is typically obtained from the mean-square displacements (MSDs). The outstanding challenge in the field is to develop a method to extract an accurate assessment of the diffusion process using many short trajectories with a simple scheme that is applicable at the nonexpert level. Here, we use deep learning to infer the underlying process resulting in anomalous diffusion. We implement a neural network to classify single-particle trajectories by diffusion type: Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion and continuous time random walk. Further, we demonstrate the applicability of our network architecture for estimating the Hurst exponent for fractional Brownian motion and the diffusion coefficient for Brownian motion on both simulated and experimental data. These networks achieve greater accuracy than time-averaged MSD analysis on simulated trajectories while only requiring as few as 25 steps. When tested on experimental data, both net and ensemble MSD analysis converge to similar values; however, the net needs only half the number of trajectories required for ensemble MSD to achieve the same confidence interval. Finally, we extract diffusion parameters from multiple extremely short trajectories (10 steps) using our approach.},

abstract = {We present a statistical learning framework for robust identification of partial differential equations (PDEs) from noisy spatiotemporal data. Extending previous sparse regression approaches for inferring PDE models from simulated data, we address key issues that have thus far limited the application of these methods to noisy experimental data, namely their robustness against noise and the need for manual parameter tuning. We address both points by proposing a stability-based model selection scheme to determine the level of regularization required for reproducible recovery of the underlying PDE. This avoids manual parameter tuning and provides a principled way to improve the method's robustness against noise in the data. Our stability selection approach, termed PDE-STRIDE, can be combined with any sparsity-promoting penalized regression model and provides an interpretable criterion for model component importance. We show that in particular the combination of stability selection with the iterative hard-thresholding algorithm from compressed sensing provides a fast, parameter-free, and robust computational framework for PDE inference that outperforms previous algorithmic approaches with respect to recovery accuracy, amount of data required, and robustness to noise. We illustrate the performance of our approach on a wide range of noise-corrupted simulated benchmark problems, including 1D Burgers, 2D vorticity-transport, and 3D reaction-diffusion problems. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method on real-world data by considering a purely data-driven re-evaluation of the advective triggering hypothesis for an embryonic polarization system in C. elegans. Using fluorescence microscopy images of C. elegans zygotes as input data, our framework is able to recover the PDE model for the regulatory reaction-diffusion-flow network of the associated proteins.},

However, it is not clear how Smo cell surface accumulation and intracellular trafficking are regulated. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of Hrs by deletion or RNAi accumulates Smo in the late endosome that is marked by late endosome markers. Inactivation of Hrs enhances the wing defects caused by dominant-negative Smo. We show that Hrs promotes Smo ubiquitination, deleting the ubiquitin-interacting-motif (UIM) in Hrs abolishes the ability of Hrs to regulate Smo ubiquitination. However, the UIM domain neither recognizes the ubiquitinated Smo nor directly interacts with Smo. Hrs lacking UIM domain still downregulates Smo activity even though to a less extent. We have characterized that the N-terminus of Hrs directly interacts with the PKA/CK1 phosphorylation clusters to prevent Smo phosphorylation and activation, indicating an ubiquitin-independent regulation of Smo by Hrs. Finally, we found that knockdown of Tsg101 accumulates Smo that is co-localized with Hrs and other late endosome markers. Taken together, our data indicate that Hrs mediates Smo trafficking in the late endosome by not only promoting Smo ubiquitination but also blocking Smo phosphorylation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Fan et al.},

Substrate ubiquitination is controlled at various stages, including through its reversal by deubiquitinases (DUBs). A critical outcome of this processis the recycling of monoubiquitin. One DUB whose function has been proposed to include monoubiquitin recycling is USP5. Here, we investigated whether Drosophila USP5 is important for maintaining monoubiquitin in vivo. We found that the fruit fly orthologue of USP5 has catalytic preferences similar to its human counterpart and that this DUB is necessary during fly development. Our biochemical and genetic experiments indicate that reduction of USP5 does not lead to monoubiquitin depletion in developing flies. Also, introduction of exogenous ubiquitin does not suppress developmental lethality caused by loss of endogenous USP5. Our work indicates that a primary physiological role of USP5 is not to recycle monoubiquitin for reutilization, but that it may involve disassembly of conjugated ubiquitin to maintain proteasome function.},

Knockdown of klf-1 suppresses the extended lifespan of both DR animals and wwp-1-overexpressing animals, indicating that KLF-1 functions within the same pathway as WWP-1. In addition, overexpression of klf-1 in the intestine is sufficient to extend the lifespan of WT animals on an ad libitum diet, and requires wwp-1 or pha-4/FoxA.

abstract = {Background: Environmental stress can affect the viability or fecundity of an organism. Environmental stressors may affect the genome or the proteome and can cause cellular distress by contributing to protein damage or misfolding. This study examines the cellular response to environmental stress in the germline of the nematode, C. elegans. Results: Salt stress, oxidative stress, and starvation, but not heat shock, induce the relocalization of ubiquitin, proteasome, and the TIAR-2 protein into distinct subnuclear regions referred to as stress induced nuclear granules (SINGs). The SINGs form within 1 h of stress initiation and do not require intertissue signaling. K48-linked polyubiquitin chains but not K63 chains are enriched in SINGs. Worms with a mutation in the conjugating enzyme, ubc-18, do not form SINGs. Additionally, knockdown of ubc-20 and ubc-22 reduces the level of SING formation as does knockdown of the ubiquitin ligase chn-1, a CHIP homolog. The nuclear import machinery is required for SING formation. Stressed embryos containing SINGs fail to hatch and cell division in these embryos is halted. The formation of SINGs can be prevented by pre-exposure to a brief period of heat shock before stress exposure. Heat shock inhibition of SINGs is dependent upon the HSF-1 transcription factor. Conclusions: The heat shock results suggest that chaperone expression can prevent SING formation and that the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins is a necessary precursor to SING formation. Thus, SINGs may be part of a novel protein quality control system. The data suggest an interesting model where SINGs represent sites of localized protein degradation for nuclear or cytosolic proteins. Thus, the physiological impacts of environmental stress may begin at the cellular level with the formation of stress induced nuclear granules.},

RING-type E3s function together with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) to mediate ubiquitination and are implicated in numerous cellular processes. In part because of their importance in human physiology and disease, these proteins and their cellular functions represent an intense area of study. Here we review recent advances in RING-type E3 recognition of substrates, their cellular regulation, and their varied architecture. Additionally, recent structural insights into RING-type E3 function, with a focus on important interactions with E2s and ubiquitin, are reviewed.},

abstract = {Caenorhabditis elegans is an animal with few cells but a wide diversity of cell types. In this study, we characterize the molecular basis for their specification by profiling the transcriptomes of 86,024 single embryonic cells. We identify 502 terminal and preterminal cell types, mapping most single-cell transcriptomes to their exact position in C. elegans' invariant lineage. Using these annotations, we find that (i) the correlation between a cell's lineage and its transcriptome increases from middle to late gastrulation, then falls substantially as cells in the nervous system and pharynx adopt their terminal fates; (ii) multilineage priming contributes to the differentiation of sister cells at dozens of lineage branches; and (iii) most distinct lineages that produce the same anatomical cell type converge to a homogenous transcriptomic state.},

abstract = {Proper positioning of cells is important for many aspects of embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. A simple mechanism by which cell positions can be specified is via orienting the cell division axis. This axis is specified at the onset of cytokinesis, but can be reoriented as cytokinesis proceeds. Rotatory actomyosin flows have been implied in specifying and reorienting the cell division axis in certain cases, but how general such reorientation events are, and how they are controlled, remains unclear. In this study, we set out to address these questions by investigating early Caenorhabditis elegans development. In particular, we determined which of the early embryonic cell divisions exhibit chiral counter-rotating actomyosin flows, and which do not. We follow the first nine divisions of the early embryo, and discover that chiral counter-rotating flows arise systematically in the early AB lineage, but not in early P/EMS lineage cell divisions. Combining our experiments with thin film active chiral fluid theory we identify specific properties of the actomyosin cortex in the symmetric AB lineage divisions that favor chiral counter-rotating actomyosin flows of the two halves of the dividing cell. Finally, we show that these counter-rotations are the driving force of both the AB lineage spindle skew and cell reorientation events. In conclusion, we here have shed light on the physical basis of lineage-specific actomyosin-based processes that drive chiral morphogenesis during development.},

abstract = {Mutagenesis in model organisms following exposure to chemicals is used as an indicator of genotoxicity. Mutagenesis assays are also used to study mechanisms of DNA homeostasis. This chapter focuses on detection of mutagenesis in prokaryotes, which boils down to two approaches: reporter inactivation (forward mutation assay) and reversion of an inactivating mutation (reversion mutation assay). Both methods are labor intensive, involving visual screening, quantification of colonies on solid media, or determining a Poisson distribution in liquid culture. Here, we present two reversion reporters for in vivo mutagenesis that produce a quantitative output, and thus have the potential to greatly reduce the amount of test chemical and labor involved in these assays. This output is obtained by coupling a TEM $\beta$ lactamase-based reversion assay with GFP fluorescence, either by placing the two genes on the same plasmid or by fusing them translationally and interrupting the N-terminus of the chimeric ORF with a stop codon. We also describe a reporter aimed at facilitating the monitoring of continuous mutagenesis in mutator strains. This reporter couples two reversion markers, allowing the temporal separation of mutation events in time, thus providing information about the dynamics of mutagenesis in mutator strains. Here, we describe these reporter systems, provide protocols for use, and demonstrate their key functional features using error-prone Pol I mutagenesis as a source of mutations.},

The protein has been crystallized at a pH ranging from 2 to 9 in three space groups, and four structures have been determined by x-ray crystallography at the resolution of 1.75-2.6 {\AA}. The pH-dependent fluorescence of mKate has been shown to be due to reversible cis-trans isomerization of the chromophore phenolic ring. In the non-fluorescent state at pH 2.0, the chromophore of mKate is in the trans-isomeric form. The weakly fluorescent state of the protein at pH 4.2 is characterized by a mixture of trans and cis isomers. The chromophore in a highly fluorescent state at pH 7.0/9.0 adopts the cis form. Three key residues, Ser143, Leu 174, and Arg197 residing in the vicinity of the chromophore, have been identified as being primarily responsible for the far-red shift in the spectra. A group of residues consisting of Val93, Arg122, Glu155, Arg157, Asp159, His169, Ile171, Asn173, Val192, Tyr194, and Val216, are most likely responsible for the observed monomeric state of the protein in solution.},

abstract = {The establishment of anterior-posterior polarity in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo requires the activity of the maternally expressed par genes. We report the identification and analysis of a new par gene, par-5. We show that par-5 is required for asynchrony and asymmetry in the first embryonic cell divisions, normal pseudocleavage, normal cleavage spindle orientation at the two-cell stage, and localization of P granules and MEX-5 during the first and subsequent cell cycles. Furthermore, par-5 activity is required in the first cell cycle for the asymmetric cortical localization of PAR-1 and PAR-2 to the posterior, and PAR-3, PAR-6, and PKC-3 to the anterior. When PAR-5 is reduced by mutation or by RNA interference, these proteins spread around the cortex of the one-cell embryo and partially overlap. We have shown by sequence analysis of par-5 mutants and by RNA interference that the par-5 gene is the same as the ftt-1 gene, and encodes a 14-3-3 protein. The PAR-5 14-3-3 protein is present in gonads, oocytes, and early embryos, but is not asymmetrically distributed. Our analysis indicates that the par-5 14-3-3 gene plays a crucial role in the early events leading to polarization of the C. elegans zygote. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science.},

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly clear that bistability (or, more generally, multistability) is an important recurring theme in cell signaling. Bistability may be of particular relevance to biological systems that switch between discrete states, generate oscillatory responses, or "remember" transitory stimuli. Standard mathematical methods allow the detection of bistability in some very simple feedback systems (systems with one or two proteins or genes that either activate each other or inhibit each other), but realistic depictions of signal transduction networks are invariably much more complex. Here, we show that for a class of feedback systems of arbitrary order the stability properties of the system can be deduced mathematically from how the system behaves when feedback is blocked. Provided that this open-loop, feedback-blocked system is monotone and possesses a sigmoidal characteristic, the system is guaranteed to be bistable for some range of feedback strengths. We present a simple graphical method for deducing the stability behavior and bifurcation diagrams for such systems and illustrate the method with two examples taken from recent experimental studies of bistable systems: a two-variable Cdc2/Wee1 system and a more complicated five-variable mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.},

Because of its compositional simplicity of only two proteins and a membrane, the MinDE system from Escherichia coli has already been invaluable for deciphering the mechanisms of spatiotemporal self-organization in cells. Here we explored the potential of reducing the complexity of this system even further, by identifying key functional motifs in the effector MinE that could be used to design pattern formation from scratch. In a combined approach of experiment and quantitative modeling, we show that starting from a minimal MinE-MinD interaction motif, pattern formation can be obtained by adding either dimerization or membrane-binding motifs.},

We will go through aPKC target proteins in cell polarity and discuss various mechanisms by which aPKC phosphorylation controls their subcellular localizations and biological functions.

abstract = {How organisms with their lives ceased stay alive and what sets their lifespans are fundamental questions relevant for microbial spores. Starved microbes can form spores whose metabolism and gene-expressions are active for hours-to-days but nearly cease upon entering dormancy. Although dormant spores can wake-up (germinate) when nutrients reappear, they die - cannot germinate - after prolonged nutrient-absences. Previous studies identified several factors that affect spore revival. But how these and as-yet-unknown intracellular factors collectively encode a dormant spore's lifespan remains poorly understood. Here we reveal an easy-to-measure, systems-level metric - a quantity that combines many intracellular factors - that accurately predicts dormant yeast-spores' lifespans by establishing dormancy as a quantity that, without nutrients, decreases at a predictable rate, thereby revealing how dormant spores approach death. We discovered different glucose-concentrations germinating distinct percentages of yeast-spores, with low glucose-concentrations priming un-germinated spores to accelerate their germinations when more glucose appears hours-to-days later. Using a synthetic circuit, we quantified dormant spores' gene-expressing ability without nutrients - a systems-level metric - whose value determines a minimum glucose-concentration required for guaranteeing germination and, for glucose concentrations below it, probability of germinating. Dormant spores' gene-expressing ability predictably decreases over days-to-months, causing glucose-concentration required for germination to increase with predictable rates until going beyond a saturating value - spore's moment of death. By introducing "dormancy spectrum" - a ruler that measures spore's proximity to death (lifespan) and to replicative life (germination capacity) - and finding dormancy's systems-level indicators, we unveiled hidden dynamics of dormant spores approaching death.},

However, it is increasingly appreciated that biochemical networks also both shape and are shaped by physical and mechanical processes [2, 3, 4]. One such process is fluid flow. In many respects, the cytoplasm, membrane and actin cortex all function as fluids, and as they flow, they drive bulk transport of molecules throughout the cell. By coupling biochemical activity to long-range molecular transport, flows can shape the distributions of molecules in space. Here, we review the various types of flows that exist in cells, with the aim of highlighting recent advances in our understanding of how flows are generated and how they contribute to intracellular patterning processes, such as the establishment of cell polarity.},

abstract = {Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades can operate as bistable switches residing in either of two different stable states. MAPK cascades are often embedded in positive feedback loops, which are considered to be a prerequisite for bistable behavior. Here we demonstrate that in the absence of any imposed feedback regulation, bistability and hysteresis can arise solely from a distributive kinetic mechanism of the two-site MAPK phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Importantly, the reported kinetic properties of the kinase (MEK) and phosphatase (MKP3) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) fulfill the essential requirements for generating a bistable switch at a single MAPK cascade level. Likewise, a cycle where multisite phosphorylations are performed by different kinases, but dephosphorylation reactions are catalyzed by the same phosphatase, can also exhibit bistability and hysteresis. Hence, bistability induced by multisite covalent modification may be a widespread mechanism of the control of protein activity.},

Par proteins are highly conserved across Metazoa, including ctenophores. But strikingly, ctenophore genomes lack components of the Wnt/PCP pathway and cell-cell adhesion complexes; raising the question if ctenophore cells are polarized by mechanisms involving Par proteins. Here, by using immunohistochemistry and live-cell imaging overexpression of specific mRNAs, we describe for the first time the subcellular localization of selected Par proteins in blastomeres and epithelial cells during the embryogenesis of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi . We show that these proteins distribute differently compared to what has been described for other animals, even though they segregate in a host-specific fashion when expressed in cnidarian embryos. This differential localization might be related to the emergence of different junctional complexes during metazoan evolution. Data obtained here challenge the ancestry of the apicobasal cell polarity and raise questions about the homology of epithelial tissue across the Metazoa.},

Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q0 and frequency 0 of the instability.},

Here we present a new theoretical approach to characterize dynamical states arbitrarily far from (global) equilibrium. We show that reaction–diffusion systems that are driven by locally mass-conserving interactions can be understood in terms of local equilibria of diffusively coupled compartments. Diffusive coupling generically induces lateral redistribution of the globally conserved quantities, and the variable local amounts of these quantities determine the local equilibria in each compartment. We find that, even far from global equilibrium, the system is well characterized by its moving local equilibria. We apply this framework to in vitro Min protein pattern formation, a paradigmatic model for biological pattern formation. Within our framework we can predict and explain transitions between chemical turbulence and order arbitrarily far from global equilibrium. Our results reveal conceptually new principles of self-organized pattern formation that may well govern diverse dynamical systems.},

While the phenomenon itself is universal, details differ across cell types, and across classes of models that have been proposed. Most models address how symmetry breaking leads to polarization, some in abstract settings, others based on specific biochemistry. Here, we compare polarization in response to a stimulus (e.g., a chemoattractant) in cells typically used in experiments (yeast, amoebae, leukocytes, keratocytes, fibroblasts, and neurons), and, in parallel, responses of several prototypical models to typical stimulation protocols. We find that the diversity of cell behaviors is reflected by a diversity of models, and that some, but not all models, can account for amplification of stimulus, maintenance of polarity, adaptation, sensitivity to new signals, and robustness.},

abstract = {We describe and analyze a bistable reaction-diffusion (RD) model for two interconverting chemical species that exhibits a phenomenon of wave-pinning: a wave of activation of one of the species is initiated at one end of the domain, moves into the domain, decelerates, and eventually stops inside the domain, forming a stationary front. The second ("inactive") species is depleted in this process. This behavior arises in a model for chemical polarization of a cell by Rho GTPases in response to stimulation. The initially spatially homogeneous concentration profile (representative of a resting cell) develops into an asymmetric stationary front profile (typical of a polarized cell). Wave-pinning here is based on three properties: (1) mass conservation in a finite domain, (2) nonlinear reaction kinetics allowing for multiple stable steady states, and (3) a sufficiently large difference in diffusion of the two species. Using matched asymptotic analysis, we explain the mathematical basis of wave-pinning, and predict the speed and pinned position of the wave. An analysis of the bifurcation of the pinned front solution reveals how the wave-pinning regime depends on parameters such as rates of diffusion and total mass of the species. We describe two ways in which the pinned solution can be lost depending on the details of the reaction kinetics: a saddle-node or a pitchfork bifurcation.},

@article{Gierer1972,
abstract = {One of the elementary processes in morphogenesis is the formation of a spatial pattern of tissue structures, starting from almost homogeneous tissue. It will be shown that relatively simple molecular mechanisms based on auto-and cross catalysis can account for a primary pattern of morphogens to determine pattern formation of the tissue. The theory is based on short range activation, long range inhibition, and a distinction between activator and inhibitor concentrations on one hand, and the densities of their sources on the other. While source density is expected to change slowly, e.g. as an effect of cell differentiation, the concentration of activators and inhibitors can change rapidly to establish the primary pattern; this results from auto-and cross catalytic effects on the sources, spreading by diffusion or other mechanisms, and degradation. Employing an approximative equation, a criterium is derived for models, which lead to a striking pattern, starting from an even distribution of morphogens, and assuming a shallow source gradient. The polarity of the pattern depends on the direction of the source gradient, but can be rather independent of other features of source distribution, Models are proposed which explain size regulation (constant proportion of the parts of the pattern irrespective of total size). Depending on the choice of constants, aperiodic patterns, implying a one-to-one correlation between morphogen concentration and position in the tissue, or nearly periodic patterns can be obtained. The theory can be applied not only to multicellular tissues, but also to intracellular differentiation, e.g. of polar cells. The theory permits various molecular interpretations. One of the simplest models involves bimolecular activation and mono-molecular inhibition. Source gradients may be substituted by, or added to, sink gradients, e.g. of degrading enzymes. Inhibitors can be substituted by substances required for, and depleted by activation. Sources may be either synthesizing systems or particulate structures releasing activators and inhibitors. Calculations by computer are presented to exemplify the main features of the theory proposed. The theory is applied to quantitative data on hydra-a suitable one-dimensional model for pattern formation-and is shown to account for activation and inhibition of secondary head formation.},

Here, we describe a new selection strategy for producing fluorescent protein (FP) knock-ins using CRISPR/Cas9-triggered homologous recombination. We have tested our approach in Caenorhabditis elegans. This approach has been designed to minimize hands-on labor at each step of the procedure. Central to our strategy is a newly developed self-excising cassette (SEC) for drug selection. SEC consists of three parts: a drug resistance gene, a visible phenotypic marker, and an inducible Cre recombinase. SEC is flanked by LoxP sites and placed within a synthetic intron of a fluorescent protein tag, resulting in an FP-SEC module that can be inserted into any C. elegans gene. Upon heat shock, SEC excises itself from the genome, leaving no exogenous sequences outside the fluorescent protein tag. With our approach, one can generate knock-in alleles in any genetic background, with no PCR screening required and without the need for a second injection step to remove the selectable marker. Moreover, this strategy makes it possible to produce a fluorescent protein fusion, a transcriptional reporter and a strong loss-of-function allele for any gene of interest in a single injection step.},

abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that ubiquitination plays a role in cancer by changing the function of key cellular proteins. Previously, we isolated BCA2 gene from a library enriched for breast tumor mRNAs. The BCA2 protein is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase and is overexpressed in human breast tumors. In order to deduce the biochemical and biological function of BCA2, we searched for BCA2-binding partners using human breast and fetal brain cDNA libraries and BacterioMatch two-hybrid system. We identified 62 interacting partners, the majority of which were found to encode ubiquitin precursor proteins including ubiquitin C and ubiquitin A-52. Using several deletion and point mutants, we found that the BCA2 zinc finger (BZF) domain at the NH 2 terminus specifically binds ubiquitin and ubiquitinated proteins. The autoubiquitination activity of BCA2, RING-H2 mutant, BZF mutant, and various lysine mutants of BCA2 were investigated. Our results indicate that the BCA2 protein is strongly ubiquitinated and no ubiquitination is detected with the BCA2 RING-H2 mutant, indicating that the RING domain is essential for autoubiquitination. Mutation of the K26 and K32 lysines in the BZF domain also abrogated autoubiquitination activity. Interestingly, mutation of the K232 and K260 lysines in and near the RING domain resulted in an increase in autoubiquitination activity. Additionally, in cellular migration assays, BCA2 mutants showed altered cell motility compared with wild-type BCA2. On the basis of these findings, we propose that BCA2 might be an important factor regulating breast cancer cell migration/metastasis. We put forward a novel model for BCA2 E3 ligase-mediated cell regulation.},

We analyzed the mitochondria-targeting signal of rat Tom20 (rTom20) in COS-7 cells, using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the reporter by systematically introducing deletions or mutations into the TMD or the flanking regions. Moderate TMD hydrophobicity and a net positive charge within five residues of the COOH-terminal flanking region were both critical for mitochondria targeting. Constructs without net positive charges within the flanking region, as well as those with high TMD hydrophobicity, were targeted to the ER-Golgi compartments. Intracellular localization of rTom20-GFP fusions, determined by fluorescence microscopy, was further verified by cell fractionation. The signal recognition particle (SRP)-induced translation arrest and photo-cross-linking demonstrated that SRP recognized the TMD of rTom20-GFP, but with reduced affinity, while the positive charge at the COOH-terminal flanking segment inhibited the translation arrest. The mitochondria-targeting signal identified in vivo also functioned in the in vitro system.

These protein networks are characterized by both complex temporal organization, such as pulses of signaling activity, and by complex spatial organization, where proteins assemble structures at particular locations and times within the cell. Yet despite their ubiquity, studying these spatial and temporal properties has remained challenging because they emerge from the entire protein network rather than a single node, and cannot be easily tuned by drugs or mutations. These challenges are being met by a new generation of optogenetic tools capable of directly controlling the activity of individual signaling nodes over time and the assembly of protein complexes in space.

Membrane localization of one such photoreceptor, BcLOV4 from Botrytis cinerea , is directly coupled to its flavin photocycle, and is mediated by a polybasic amphipathic helix in the linker region between the LOV sensor and its C-terminal domain of unknown function (DUF), as revealed through a combination of bioinformatics, computational protein modeling, structure–function studies, and optogenetic assays in yeast and mammalian cell line expression systems. In model systems, BcLOV4 rapidly translocates from the cytosol to plasma membrane (∼1 second). The reversible electrostatic interaction is nonselective among anionic phospholipids, exhibiting binding strengths dependent on the total anionic content of the membrane without preference for a specific headgroup. The in vitro and cellular responses were also observed with a BcLOV4 homolog and thus are likely to be general across the dikarya LOV class, whose members are associated with regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domains. Natural photoreceptors are not previously known to directly associate with membrane phospholipids in a light-dependent manner, and thus this work establishes both a photosensory signal transmission mode and a single-component optogenetic tool with rapid membrane localization kinetics that approaches the diffusion limit.},

abstract = {The association of molecules within membrane microdomains is critical for the intracellular organization of cells. During polarization of the C. elegans zygote, both polarity proteins and actomyosin regulators associate within dynamic membrane-associated foci. Recently, a novel class of asymmetric membrane-associated structures was described that appeared to be enriched in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), suggesting that PIP2 domains could constitute signaling hubs to promote cell polarization and actin nucleation. Here, we probe the nature of these domains using a variety of membrane- and actin cortex-associated probes. These data demonstrate that these domains are filopodia, which are stimulated transiently during polarity establishment and accumulate in the zygote anterior. The resulting membrane protrusions create local membrane topology that quantitatively accounts for observed local increases in the fluorescence signal of membrane-associated molecules, suggesting molecules are not selectively enriched in these domains relative to bulk membrane and that the PIP2 pool as revealed by PHPLC$\delta$1 simply reflects plasma membrane localization. Given the ubiquity of 3D membrane structures in cells, including filopodia, microvilli and membrane folds, similar caveats are likely to apply to analysis of membrane-associated molecules in a broad range of systems.},

abstract = {Reaction–diffusion networks underlie pattern formation in a range of biological contexts, from morphogenesis of organisms to the polarization of individual cells. One requirement for such molecular networks is that output patterns be scaled to system size. At the same time, kinetic properties of constituent molecules constrain the ability of networks to adapt to size changes. Here, we explore these constraints and the consequences thereof within the conserved PAR cell polarity network. Using the stem-cell-like germ lineage of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo as a model, we find that the behaviour of PAR proteins fails to scale with cell size. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this lack of scaling results in a size threshold below which polarity is destabilized, yielding an unpolarized system. In empirically constrained models, this threshold occurs near the size at which germ lineage cells normally switch between asymmetric and symmetric modes of division. Consistent with cell size limiting polarity and division asymmetry, genetic or physical reduction in germ lineage cell size is sufficient to trigger loss of polarity in normally polarizing cells at predicted size thresholds. Physical limits of polarity networks may be one mechanism by which cells read out geometrical features to inform cell fate decisions.},

Here, we reconstructed Par-dependent polarity using non-polarized Drosophila S2 cells expressing all three components endogenously in the cytoplasm.

Its asymmetric distribution goes through three steps: emergence of cortical dots, development of island-like structures with dynamic amorphous shapes, repeating fusion and fission, and polarized clustering of the islands. Our findings also showed that these islands contain a meshwork of unit-like segments. Furthermore, Par-complex patches resembling Par-islands exist in Drosophila mitotic neuroblasts. Thus, this reconstruction system provides an experimental paradigm to study features of the assembly process and structure of Par-dependent cell-autonomous polarity.},

To reveal potentially unifying principles, we discuss mathematical conceptualizations of several prototypical examples. We suggest that the concept of local activation and global inhibition - originally developed to explain spatial patterning in reaction-diffusion systems - provides a framework for understanding many cases of cell polarity. Importantly, we find that the core ingredients in this framework - symmetry breaking, self-amplifying feedback, and long-range inhibition - involve processes that can be chemical, mechanical, or even mechanochemical in nature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In budding yeast, such polarization involves a positive feedback loop that enables amplification of stochastically arising clusters of polarity factors. Previous mathematical modeling suggested that, if more than one cluster were amplified, the clusters would compete for limiting resources and the largest would "win," explaining why yeast cells always make one and only one bud. Here, using imaging with improved spatiotemporal resolution, we show the transient coexistence of multiple clusters during polarity establishment, as predicted by the model. Unexpectedly, we also find that initial polarity factor clustering is oscillatory, revealing the presence of a negative feedback loop that disperses the factors. Mathematical modeling predicts that negative feedback would confer robustness to the polarity circuit and make the kinetics of competition between polarity factor clusters relatively insensitive to polarity factor concentration. These predictions are confirmed experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We transgenically expressed mitochondrially targeted miniSOG (mito-miniSOG) in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons. Upon blue-light illumination, mitominiSOG causes rapid and effective death of neurons in a cell-autonomous manner without detectable damages to surrounding tissues. Neuronal death induced by mito-miniSOG appears to be independent of the caspase CED-3, but the clearance of the damaged cells partially depends on the phagocytic receptor CED-1, a homolog of human CD91. We show that neurons can be killed at different developmental stages. We further use this method to investigate the role of the premotor interneurons in regulating the convulsive behavior caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the neuronal acetylcholine receptor acr-2. Our findings support an instructive role for the interneuron AVB in controlling motor neuron activity and reveal an inhibitory effect of the backward premotor interneurons on the forward interneurons. In summary, the simple inducible cell ablation method reported here allows temporal and spatial control and will prove to be a useful tool in studying the function of specific cells within complex cellular contexts.},

abstract = {Daughter cells with distinct fates can arise through intrinsically asymmetrical divisions. Before such divisions, factors crucial for determining cell fates become asymmetrically localized in the mother cell. In Caenorhabditis elegans, PAR proteins are required for the early asymmetrical divisions that establish embryonic polarity, and are asymmetrically localized in early blastomeres, although the mechanism of their distribution is not known. Here we report the identification in C. elegans of a non-muscle myosin II heavy chain (designated NMY-2) by means of its interaction with the PAR-1 protein, a putative Ser/Thr protein kinase. Furthermore, injections of nmy-2 antisense RNA into ovaries of adult worms cause embryonic partitioning defects and lead to mislocalization of PAR proteins. We therefore conclude that NMY-2 is required for establishing cellular polarity in C. elegans embryos.},

abstract = {During metazoan development, immune surveillance and cancer dissemination, cells migrate in complex three-dimensional microenvironments1–3. These spaces are crowded by cells and extracellular matrix, generating mazes with differently sized gaps that are typically smaller than the diameter of the migrating cell4,5. Most mesenchymal and epithelial cells and some—but not all—cancer cells actively generate their migratory path using pericellular tissue proteolysis6. By contrast, amoeboid cells such as leukocytes use non-destructive strategies of locomotion7, raising the question how these extremely fast cells navigate through dense tissues. Here we reveal that leukocytes sample their immediate vicinity for large pore sizes, and are thereby able to choose the path of least resistance. This allows them to circumnavigate local obstacles while effectively following global directional cues such as chemotactic gradients. Pore-size discrimination is facilitated by frontward positioning of the nucleus, which enables the cells to use their bulkiest compartment as a mechanical gauge. Once the nucleus and the closely associated microtubule organizing centre pass the largest pore, cytoplasmic protrusions still lingering in smaller pores are retracted. These retractions are coordinated by dynamic microtubules; when microtubules are disrupted, migrating cells lose coherence and frequently fragment into migratory cytoplasmic pieces. As nuclear positioning in front of the microtubule organizing centre is a typical feature of amoeboid migration, our findings link the fundamental organization of cellular polarity to the strategy of locomotion.},

Localization of MARK/PAR-1 kinases to specific regions of the cell cortex is a hallmark of polarized cells. In Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, PAR-1 localizes to the posterior cortex under the influence of another polarity kinase, aPKC/PKC-3. Here, we report that asymmetric localization of PAR-1 protein is not essential, and that PAR-1 kinase activity is regulated spatially. We find that, as in human MARK1, the PAR-1 KA1 domain is an auto-inhibitory domain that suppresses kinase activity. Auto-inhibition by the KA1 domain functions in parallel with phosphorylation by PKC-3 to suppress PAR-1 activity in the anterior cytoplasm. The KA1 domain also plays an additional role that is essential for germ plasm maintenance and fertility. Our findings suggest that modular regulation of kinase activity by redundant inhibitory inputs contributes to robust symmetry breaking by MARK/PAR-1 kinases in diverse cell types.},

The activity of most E3s is specified by a RING domain, which binds to an E2∼ubiquitin thioester and activates discharge of its ubiquitin cargo. E2-E3 complexes can either monoubiquitinate a substrate lysine or synthesize polyubiqui-tin chains assembled via different lysine residues of ubiquitin. These modifications can have diverse effects on the substrate, ranging from proteasome-dependent proteolysis to modulation of protein function, structure, assembly, and/or localization. Not surprisingly, RING E3-mediated ubiquitination can be regulated in a number of ways. RING-based E3s are specified by over 600 human genes, surpassing the 518 protein kinase genes. Accordingly, RING E3s have been linked to the control of many cellular processes and to multiple human diseases. Despite their critical importance, our knowledge of the physiological partners, biological functions, substrates, and mechanism of action for most RING E3s remains at a rudimentary stage.},

abstract = {Compartmentalization is a characterizing feature of complexity in cells, used to organize their biochemistry. Membrane-bound organelles are most widely known, but non-membrane-bound liquid organelles also exist. These have recently been shown to form by phase separation of specific types of proteins known as scaffolds. This forms two phases: a condensate that is enriched in scaffold protein separated by a phase boundary from the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm with a low concentration of the scaffold protein. Phase separation is well known for synthetic polymers, but also appears important in cells. Here, we review the properties of proteins important for forming these non-membrane-bound organelles, focusing on the energetically favourable interactions that drive condensation. On this basis we make qualitative predictions about how cells may control compartmentalization by condensates; the partition of specific molecules to a condensate; the control of condensation and dissolution of condensates; and the regulation of condensate nucleation. There are emerging data supporting many of these predictions, although future results may prove incorrect. It appears that many molecules may have the ability to modulate condensate formation, making condensates a potential target for future therapeutics. The emerging properties of condensates are fundamentally unlike the properties of membrane-bound organelles. They have the capacity to rapidly integrate cellular events and act as a new class of sensors for internal and external environments.This article is part of the theme issue 'Self-organization in cell biology'.},

It plays a vital role in protecting the integrity of the cell interior and regulates meticulously the import and export of diverse substances. Its major building blocks are proteins and lipids, which self-assemble to a fluid lipid bilayer driven mainly by hydrophobic forces. Even if the plasma membrane appears-globally speaking-homogeneous at physiological temperatures, the existence of specialized nano- to micrometre-sized domains of raft-type character within cellular and synthetic membrane systems has been reported. It is hypothesized that these domains are the origin of a plethora of cellular processes, such as signalling or vesicular trafficking. This review intends to highlight the driving forces of lipid self-assembly into a bilayer membrane and the formation of small, transient domains within the plasma membrane. The mechanisms of self-assembly depend on several factors, such as the lipid composition of the membrane and the geometry of lipids. Moreover, the dynamics and organization of glycosphingolipids into nanometre-sized clusters will be discussed, also in the context of multivalent lectins, which cluster several glycosphingolipid receptor molecules and thus create an asymmetric stress between the two membrane leaflets, leading to tubular plasma membrane invaginations.This article is part of the theme issue 'Self-organization in cell biology'.},

In general, actin binding to ternary membranes prevented macroscopic liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domain formation, even at low temperature. Instead, depending on the type of pinning lipid, an actin correlated multi-domain pattern was observed. FCS measurements revealed hindered diffusion of lipids in the presence of an actin network. To explain our experimental findings, a new simulation model is proposed, in which the membrane composition, the membrane curvature, and the actin pinning sites are all coupled.

abstract = {Most vertebrates exhibit non-random spatial variation of their skin colour, that is, they present a colour pattern. Depending on the species, individual and body area, these symmetry-breaking regularities can take various forms such as stripes, spots, tessellations, meanders and labyrinths. Patterns can either be fixed at birth or change during the life of the animal. These macroscopic patterns result from sustained nonequilibrium dissipative microscopic systems that clearly involve short-range and long-range interactions among biological cells 1-5. At the macroscopic scale, such dynamical processes can be approximated as involving continuous media and can be described quantitatively with nonlinear partial differential equations similar to those used in the reaction-diffusion (RD) framework 6-10. Squamates (lizards and snakes) are interesting models in which to study skin pattern development because many species exhibit a broad variety of colours and patterns. Typically, the colour of a lizard's patch of skin is the result of a combination of structural and pigmentary elements found in various types of chromatophores 11-15. Iridophore cells produce structural colours through light interference (due to the presence of quasi-ordered arrays of guanine nanocrystals 15), but all other chromatophores contain pigments: brown/black melanins in melanophores, yellow pteridines/carotenoids in xanthophores and red pteridines/carotenoids in erythrophores 16. For example, many species of squamates (and of amphibians) use such non-trivial combinations of cell types to produce green 14 , one of the most ubiquitous skin colours in nature (because it blends into chlorophyll-rich environments). In many species, individuals can additionally control their brightness by dispersion or aggregation of intracellular melanin-containing organelles 17-20 , and several chameleon species can change colours (hue) for the purpose of social signalling through the active tuning of a three-dimensional (3D) lattice of guanine nanocrystals within iridophores 15. The development of a specific skin colour pattern is produced by a nonlinear dynamical system of biological cell interactions that simultaneously establishes the co-localization of pigmentary and structural elements (generating a specific perceived colour) and their spatial variation (generating a pattern). However, the formation and onto-genic dynamics of skin colour in the ocellated lizard (Timon lepidus) seems to conflict with this RD framework, given that mesoscopic skin scales, rather than individual chromatophore cells, establish the pattern. Indeed, the juvenile pattern is made of white ocelli on a brown background (Fig. 1a) but develops later into a labyrinthine pattern (Fig. 1b-g): each adult scale is essentially homogeneous in colour and is either green or black. Hence, the relevant dynamic occurs between the microscopic and macroscopic scales: the (spatial) scale of (skin) scales. Note that we choose to ignore the ventral scales (which remain white throughout the life of the animal) and the development of blue ocelli on the flanks. Here we analyse the dynamics of the skin colour pattern formation in ocellated lizards and demonstrate that this labyrinthine pattern is computed on a discrete-state dynamical lattice of mesoscopic elements (the skin scales) by a quasi-hexagonal probabilistic cellular automaton (CA). After identifying the rule of the CA, we perform continuous and discrete RD modelling to identify how a CA behaviour (at the spatial scale of skin scales) can emerge from the paradigmatic nonlinear interactions among chromatophores (at a much smaller spatial scale). Our multi-scale analyses suggest that the morphological patterning of the skin into scales generates 3D geometric variations that affect the cell interactions and cause the emergence of a CA behaviour exactly superposed on the skin scales. Chromatophore densities obey diffusion equations but reactions among cells make the situation more intricate. It was first theoretically understood by Turing 6 , the implications of whose work have since been widely studied 7,21 , that, at some parameter values, the nonlinearity of the resulting (non-scale invariant) RD equations generates various patterns at a specific spatial scale 22,23. The 3D RD dynamics in the skin layer can be projected to a two-dimensional (2D) RD equation on the surface of the skin. However, we suggest that the 3D geometry of the In vertebrates, skin colour patterns emerge from nonlinear dynamical microscopic systems of cell interactions. Here we show that in ocellated lizards a quasi-hexagonal lattice of skin scales, rather than individual chromatophore cells, establishes a green and black labyrinthine pattern of skin colour. We analysed time series of lizard scale colour dynamics over four years of their development and demonstrate that this pattern is produced by a cellular automaton (a grid of elements whose states are iterated according to a set of rules based on the states of neighbouring elements) that dynamically computes the colour states of individual mesoscopic skin scales to produce the corresponding macroscopic colour pattern. Using numerical simulations and mathematical derivation, we identify how a discrete von Neumann cellular automaton emerges from a continuous Turing reaction-diffusion system. Skin thickness variation generated by three-dimensional morphogenesis of skin scales causes the underlying reaction-diffusion dynamics to separate into microscopic and mesoscopic spatial scales, the latter generating a cellular automaton. Our study indicates that cellular automata are not merely abstract computational systems, but can directly correspond to processes generated by biological evolution.},

In nematodes, this coat is the eggshell, which provides mechanical rigidity, prevents polyspermy, and is impermeable to small molecules. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we found that the Caenorhabditis elegans eggshell was composed of an outer vitelline layer, a middle chitin layer, and an inner layer containing chondroitin proteoglycans. The switch between the chitin and proteoglycan layers was achieved by internalization of chitin synthase coincident with exocytosis of proteoglycan-containing cortical granules. Inner layer assembly did not make the zygote impermeable as previously proposed. Instead, correlative light and electron microscopy demonstrated that the permeability barrier was a distinct envelope that formed in a separate step that required fatty acid synthesis, the sugar-modifying enzyme PERM-1, and the acyl chain transfer enzyme DGTR-1. These findings delineate the hierarchy of eggshell assembly and define key molecular mechanisms at each step.},

Spindle positioning is driven by dynein-mediated pulling forces exerted on astral microtubules, which requires an evolutionarily conserved complex of G$\alpha$∙GDP, GPR-1/2Pins/LGN, and LIN-5Mud/NuMA proteins. To examine individual functions of the complex components, we developed a genetic strategy for light-controlled localization of endogenous proteins in C. elegans embryos. By replacing G$\alpha$ and GPR-1/2 with a light-inducible membrane anchor, we demonstrate that G$\alpha$∙GDP, G$\alpha$∙GTP, and GPR-1/2 are not required for pulling-force generation. In the absence of G$\alpha$ and GPR-1/2, cortical recruitment of LIN-5, but not dynein itself, induced high pulling forces. The light-controlled localization of LIN-5 overruled normal cell-cycle and polarity regulation and provided experimental control over the spindle and cell-cleavage plane. Our results define G$\alpha$∙GDP–GPR-1/2Pins/LGN as a regulatable membrane anchor, and LIN-5Mud/NuMA as a potent activator of dynein-dependent spindle-positioning forces.},

The par-2 gene is required for the unequal first cleavage and for asymmetries in cell cycle length and spindle orientation in the two resulting daughter cells. We have found that the PAR-2 protein is present in adult gonads and early embryos. In gonads, the protein is uniformly distributed at the cell cortex, and this subcellular localization depends on microfilaments. In the one-cell embryo, PAR-2 is localized to the posterior cortex and is partitioned into the posterior daughter, P1, at the first cleavage. PAR-2 exhibits a similar asymmetric cortical localization in P1, P2, and P3, the asymmetrically dividing blastomeres of germ line lineage. This distribution in embryos is very similar to that of PAR-1 protein. By analyzing the distribution of the PAR-2 protein in various par mutant backgrounds we found that proper asymmetric distribution of PAR-2 depends upon par-3 activity but not upon par-1 or par-4. par-2 activity is required for proper cortical localization of PAR-1 and this effect requires wild-type par-3 gene activity. We also find that, although par-2 activity is not required for posterior localization of P granules at the one-cell stage, it is required for proper cortical association of P granules in P1.},

abstract = {Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play a fundamental role in eukaryotic signaling. Some 30% of proteins are phosphorylated at any time, many on multiple sites, raising the question of how the cellular phosphorylation state is regulated. Previous work for one and two phosphorylation sites has revealed mechanisms, such as distributive phosphorylation, for switch-like regulation of maximally phosphorylated phosphoforms. These insights have led to the influential view that more phosphorylation sites leads to steeper switching, as proposed for substrates like cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1. An analytical study of the ordered distributive case reveals a more complex story. Multisite phosphorylation creates an efficient threshold: The proportion of maximally phosphorylated substrate is maintained close to 0 when the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity lies below a suitable threshold, and this threshold increases with increasing numbers of sites, n. However, above the threshold, the response may not always abruptly switch between 0 and 1, as would be the case for an efficient switch, but may increase in a gradual manner, which becomes more hyperbolic with increasing n. Abrupt switching cannot be attributed merely to n being large. We point out that conventional measures of ultrasensitivity must be modified to discriminate between thresholding and switching; we discuss additional factors that influence switching efficiency and suggest new directions for experimental investigation. cellular phosphorylation state distributive versus processive ultrasensitivity multistability},

In wild type Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, symmetry breaking during anterior-posterior axis specification is guided by centrosomes, resulting in anterior-directed cortical flows and a single posterior PAR-2 domain. We uncover that C. elegans zygotes depleted of the Aurora A kinase AIR-1 or lacking centrosomes entirely usually establish two posterior PAR-2 domains, one at each pole. We demonstrate that AIR-1 prevents symmetry breaking early in the cell cycle, whereas centrosomal AIR-1 instructs polarity initiation thereafter. Using triangular microfabricated chambers, we establish that bipolarity of air-1(RNAi) embryos occurs effectively in a cell-shape and curvature-dependent manner. Furthermore, we develop an integrated physical description of symmetry breaking, wherein local PAR-2-dependent weakening of the actin cortex, together with mutual inhibition of anterior and posterior PAR proteins, provides a mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking without centrosomes.},

abstract = {The fluid-mosaic model posits a liquid-like plasma membrane, which can flow in response to tension gradients. It is widely assumed that membrane flow transmits local changes in membrane tension across the cell in milliseconds. This conjectured signaling mechanism has been invoked to explain how cells coordinate changes in shape, motility, and vesicle fusion, but the underlying propagation has never been observed. Here we show that propagation of membrane tension occurs quickly in cell-attached blebs, but is largely suppressed in intact cells. The failure of tension to propagate in cells is explained by a fluid dynamical model that incorporates the flow resistance from cytoskeleton-bound transmembrane proteins. In primary endothelial cells, local increases in membrane tension lead only to local activation of mechanosensitive ion channels and to local vesicle fusion. Thus membrane tension is not a mediator of long-range intra-cellular signaling, but local variations in tension mediate distinct processes in sub-cellular domains.},

Here, we study dormancy in different eukaryotic organisms and find it to be associated with a significant decrease in the mobility of organelles and foreign tracer particles. We show that this reduced mobility is caused by an influx of protons and a marked acidification of the cytoplasm, which leads to widespread macromolecular assembly of proteins and triggers a transition of the cytoplasm to a solid-like state with increased mechanical stability. We further demonstrate that this transition is required for cellular survival under conditions of starvation. Our findings have broad implications for understanding alternative physiological states, such as quiescence and dormancy, and create a new view of the cytoplasm as an adaptable fluid that can reversibly transition into a protective solid-like state.},

abstract = {Cell polarity endows cells with a reference frame that guides cellular organization and division. In the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, PAR protein patterns determine the anterior-posterior axis and facilitate the redistribution of proteins for the first asymmetric cell division. While previous theoretical work has shown that mutual antagonism between (anterior) aPAR and (posterior) pPAR proteins is the key to polarity maintenance, what factors determine the selection of the polarity axis remains unclear. Here we formulate a reaction-diffusion model in a realistic cell geometry, based on bimolecular reactions and fully accounting for the coupling between membrane and cytosolic dynamics. We find that the kinetics of the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of PAR proteins is crucial for the selection of the long (anterior-posterior) axis for polarization. Biochemical cycles based on mutual exclusion alone, without a delay in dephosphorylation, would lead to short (dorsal-ventral) axis polarization. Our analysis shows that the local ratio of membrane surface to cytosolic bulk volume is the main geometric cue to which patterns adapt, and the decisive parameter that determines axis selection is given by the ratio of the diffusive length of the phosphorylated (inactive) phase to the cell length. We quantify the effect of relative protein numbers and find that they primarily affect the robustness of protein pattern formation. In particular, robustness to variations in the phosphorylation rates increases if scaffold proteins like PAR-3 are more abundant than PKC-3, which phosphorylates pPARs. Together, our theoretical study reveals the crucial role of geometry in self-organized protein pattern formation: axis selection is based on the generic dependence of intracellular pattern-forming processes on the local ratio of membrane surface to cytosolic volume.},

abstract = {The physical nature of the bacterial cytoplasm is poorly understood even though it determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that the bacterial cytoplasm displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, the motion of cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes the cytoplasm, allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions of the cytoplasm. Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications to our understanding of bacterial physiology, as the glassy behavior of the cytoplasm impacts all intracellular processes involving large components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Specification of germline and somatic cell lineages in C. elegans originates in the polarized single-cell zygote. Several cell-fate determinants are partitioned unequally along the anterior-posterior axis of the zygote, ensuring the daughter cells a unique inheritance upon asymmetric cell division. Recent studies have revealed that partitioning of the germline determinant PIE-1 and the somatic determinant MEX-5 involve protein redistribution accompanied by spatiotemporal changes in protein diffusion rates. Here, we characterize the dynamics of MEX-5 in the zygote and propose a novel reaction/diffusion model to explain both its anterior enrichment and its remarkable intracellular dynamics without requiring asymmetrically distributed binding sites. We propose that asymmetric cortically localized PAR proteins mediate the anterior enrichment of MEX-5 by reversibly changing its diffusion rate at spatially distinct points in the embryo, thus generating a stable concentration gradient along the anterior-posterior axis of the cell. This work extends the scope of reaction/diffusion models to include not only germline morphogens, but also somatic determinants.},

Here, we combined quantitative imaging with genetic perturbations to identify a core mechanism for pulsed contractility in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We show that pulsed accumulation of actomyosin is governed by local control of assembly and disassembly downstream of RhoA. Pulsed activation and inactivation of RhoA precede, respectively, the accumulation and disappearance of actomyosin and persist in the absence of Myosin II. We find that fast (likely indirect) autoactivation of RhoA drives pulse initiation, while delayed, F-actin-dependent accumulation of the RhoA GTPase-activating proteins RGA-3/4 provides negative feedback to terminate each pulse. A mathematical model, constrained by our data, suggests that this combination of feedbacks is tuned to generate locally excitable RhoA dynamics. We propose that excitable RhoA dynamics are a common driver for pulsed contractility that can be tuned or coupled differently to actomyosin dynamics to produce a diversity of morphogenetic outcomes.},

It has been suggested that the eggshell surrounding the early embryo plays a role in polarization although its function is not understood. Here we develop a mathematical model which couples a reaction-diffusion model of actomyosin dynamics with a phase field model of the cell cortex to implicitly track cell shape changes in the early C. elegans embryo. We investigate the potential rigidity effect of the geometric constraint imposed by the presence and size of the eggshell on polarization dynamics. Our model suggests that the geometric constraint of the eggshell is essential for proper polarization and the size of the eggshell also affects the dynamics of polarization. Therefore, we conclude that geometric constraint on a cell might affect the dynamics of a biochemical process.},

abstract = {C ell polarity establishment in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes is a prototypical example for cellular pattern formation that depends both on feedback between two classes of pattern-forming proteins and on upstream guiding cues provided by the centrosomal polarity trigger 1-3. Posterior PAR proteins (pPARs: PAR-1, PAR-2 and LGL-1) and anterior PAR proteins (aPARs: PAR-6, PAR-3 and PKC-3) interact via antagonistic feedback while bound to the cell cortex 4 , which gives rise to stably unpolarized and polarized states 5-7. The formation of PAR polarity domains involves actomyosin cortical flows that transport PAR proteins 6,8-11. In addition , PAR proteins regulate the actomyosin cortex 8,12-16 , implying mechanochemical feedback 17. Two centrosomal polarity triggers act as guiding cues for the polarization process 1-3. First, centrosomal microtubules protect PAR-2 from PKC-3-mediated antagonism 5. Second, contractility in the actomyosin cortex is increased via RhoA activation 18 , and a local down-regulation of non-muscle myosin II (NMY-2, referred to as myosin) at the posterior pole 19 initiates cortical flows 8,20. The relationship between guiding cues and feedback in PAR polarity establishment remains unclear. To address this issue, we first focus on feedback and later shift our attention to the guiding cues and their relation to the mechanisms of feedback. Previous work has investigated antagonistic feedback between the two PAR species 4,6,21. We set out to characterize mechano-chemical feedback from PAR proteins onto actomyosin contrac-tility. Cortical myosin is regulated by PAR domains 8,12-16 , but the strength of this regulation in terms of changes of myosin association and dissociation rates remains unknown. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a technique for determining dissociation rates at steady state 22,23 (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Section 1.2). Performing FRAP during maintenance phase where myosin appears to reach a steady state (Supplementary Fig. 2a,c, Supplementary Discussion 1.2), we found that the rate of NMY-2 dissociation from the cortex is about twice as high in the posterior compared to the anterior PAR domain (posterior, k diss = 0.14 ± 0.01 s −1 ; anterior, k diss = 0.072 ± 0.009 s −1) (Fig. 1b). The spontaneous dissociation rate of myosin in the anterior during maintenance is similar to the one reported during cortical flows, as measured via co-moving mass-balance imaging 24 (COMBI). This indicates that myosin reaction kinetics do not change much over these stages of the cell cycle. We next determined the rate of NMY-2 association to the cortex by considering that the steady-state surface concentration of NMY-2 is set by the ratio of this association rate and the dissociation rate from the cortex. To this end, we developed a fluorescence-based image quantification technique (MACE: membrane-associated concentration evaluation) that determines the spatiotemporal concentration fields of labelled proteins at the cell surface (Fig. 1a, see also ref. 25). We find that the rates of association of NMY-2 to the cortex are similar in both PAR domains (anterior: k on = 0.19 ± 0.03 $\mu$ m s −1 , posterior: k on = 0.21 ± 0.03 $\mu$ m s −1) (Fig. 1d), indicating that NMY-2 association to the cortex is independent of PARs. However, changing the local PAR state of the cortex via RNAi changes the local NMY-2 dissociation rate (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 2k), indicating that the PAR domain state controls NMY-2 dissociation from the cortex. We next asked if the posterior or the anterior PAR complex regulates the NMY-2 dis-sociation rate. To this end, we measured the NMY-2 dissociation rate during par-2 and par-6 double-RNAi (Supplementary Fig. 2j). Under this condition, the NMY-2 dissociation rate is not much different from the one measured in the posterior domain of unper-turbed embryos (Fig. 1b), indicating that the anterior PAR complex Spontaneous pattern formation in Turing systems relies on feedback. But patterns in cells and tissues seldom form spontaneously instead they are controlled by regulatory biochemical interactions that provide molecular guiding cues. The relationship between these guiding cues and feedback in controlled biological pattern formation remains unclear. Here, we explore this relationship during cell-polarity establishment in the one-cell-stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. We quantify the strength of two feedback systems that operate during polarity establishment: feedback between polarity proteins and the actomyosin cortex, and mutual antagonism among polarity proteins. We characterize how these feedback systems are modulated by guiding cues from the centrosome, an organelle regulating cell cycle progression. By coupling a mass-conserved Turing-like reaction diffusion system for polarity proteins to an active-gel description of the actomyosin cortex, we reveal a transition point beyond which feedback ensures self-organized polarization, even when cues are removed. Notably, the system switches from a guide-dominated to a feedback-dominated regime well beyond this transition point, which ensures robustness. Together, these results reveal a general criterion for controlling biological pattern-forming systems: feedback remains subcritical to avoid unstable behaviour, and molecular guiding cues drive the system beyond a transition point for pattern formation.

abstract = {Animal cell shape is controlled primarily by the actomyosin cortex, a thin cytoskeletal network that lies directly beneath the plasma membrane. The cortex regulates cell morphology by controlling cellular mechanical properties, which are determined by network structure and geometry. In particular, cortex thickness is expected to influence cell mechanics. However , cortex thickness is near the resolution limit of the light microscope, making studies relating cortex thickness and cell shape challenging. To overcome this, we developed an assay to measure cortex thickness in live cells, combining confocal imaging and subresolution image analysis. We labeled the actin cortex and plasma membrane with chromatically different fluorophores and measured the distance between the resulting intensity peaks. Using a theoretical description of cortex geometry and microscopic imaging, we extracted an average cortex thickness of $\sim$190 nm in mitotic HeLa cells and tested the validity of our assay using cell images generated in silico. We found that thickness increased after experimental treatments preventing F-actin disassembly. Finally, we monitored physiological changes in cortex thickness in real-time during actin cortex regrowth in cellular blebs. Our investigation paves the way to understanding how molecular processes modulate cortex structure, which in turn drives cell morphogenesis.},

We provide evidence that two nearly identical genes, mex-5 and mex-6, link PAR asymmetry to those subsequent protein asymmetries. MEX-5 is a novel, cytoplasmic protein that is localized through PAR activities to the anterior pole of the 1-cell stage embryo. MEX-5 localization is reciprocal to that of a group of posterior-localized proteins called germline proteins. Ectopic expression of MEX-5 is sufficient to inhibit the expression of germline proteins, suggesting that MEX-5 functions to inhibit anterior expression of the germline proteins.},

Using time-lapse microscopy and GFP fusions, we have analyzed the localization dynamics of PAR-2, PAR-6, MEX-5, MEX-6 and PIE-1 in wild-type and mutant embryos. These studies reveal that polarization involves two genetically and temporally distinct phases. During the first phase (establishment), the sperm asters at one end of the embryo exclude the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC3 complex from the nearby cortex, allowing the ring finger protein PAR-2 to accumulate in an expanding 'posterior' domain. Onset of the establishment phase involves the non-muscle myosin NMY-2 and the 14-3-3 protein PAR-5. The kinase PAR-1 and the CCCH finger proteins MEX-5 and MEX-6 also function during the establishment phase in a feedback loop to regulate growth of the posterior domain. The second phase begins after pronuclear meeting, when the sperm asters begin to invade the anterior. During this phase (maintenance), PAR-2 maintains anterior-posterior polarity by excluding the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC3 complex from the posterior. These findings provide a model for how PAR and MEX proteins convert a transient asymmetry into a stably polarized axis.},

We show here that patterns of cell contact provide cues that diversify cell division orientation by modulating cortical non-muscle myosin flow. We reconstituted in vivo contact patterns using beads or isolated cells to show two findings. First, we identified three contact-dependent cues that pattern cell division orientation and myosin flow: physical contact, contact asymmetry, and a Wnt signal. Second, we experimentally demonstrated that myosin flow generates forces that trigger plasma membrane movements and propose that their anisotropy drives cell division orientation. Our data suggest that contact-dependent control of myosin specifies the division axes of Caenorhabditis elegans AB, ABa, EMS cells, and the mouse AB cell. The contact pattern-dependent generation of myosin flows, in concert with known microtubule/dynein pathways, may greatly expand division axis diversity during development.},

In the current era of abundance of data and advanced machine learning capabilities, the natural question arises: How can we automatically uncover the underlying laws of physics from high-dimensional data generated from experiments? In this work, we put forth a deep learning approach for discovering nonlinear partial differential equations from scattered and potentially noisy observations in space and time. Specifically, we approximate the unknown solution as well as the nonlinear dynamics by two deep neural networks. The first network acts as a prior on the unknown solution and essentially enables us to avoid numerical differentiations which are inherently ill-conditioned and unstable. The second network represents the nonlinear dynamics and helps us distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given spatiotemporal data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems spanning a number of scientific domains and demonstrate how the proposed framework can help us accurately learn the underlying dynamics and forecast future states of the system. In particular, we study the Burgers', Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger, and Navier-Stokes equations.},

abstract = {Developing algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time, due to the notoriously difficult problem known as the "curse of dimensionality." This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs. To this end, the PDEs are reformu-lated using backward stochastic differential equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation , the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and cost. This opens up possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their interrelationships. partial differential equations | backward stochastic differential equations | high dimension | deep learning | Feynman-Kac P artial differential equations (PDEs) are among the most ubiquitous tools used in modeling problems in nature. Some of the most important ones are naturally formulated as PDEs in high dimensions. Well-known examples include the following: i) The Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation in the quantum many-body problem. In this case the dimensionality of the PDE is roughly three times the number of electrons or quantum particles in the system. ii) The nonlinear Black-Scholes equation for pricing financial derivatives, in which the dimensionality of the PDE is the number of underlying financial assets under consideration. iii) The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in dynamic programming. In a game theory setting with multiple agents, the dimensionality goes up linearly with the number of agents. Similarly, in a resource allocation problem, the dimen-sionality goes up linearly with the number of devices and resources. As elegant as these PDE models are, their practical use has proved to be very limited due to the curse of dimensionality (1): The computational cost for solving them goes up exponentially with the dimensionality. Another area where the curse of dimensionality has been an essential obstacle is machine learning and data analysis, where the complexity of nonlinear regression models, for example, goes up exponentially with the dimensionality. In both cases the essential problem we face is how to represent or approximate a nonlinear function in high dimensions. The traditional approach, by building functions using polynomials, piecewise polynomials, wavelets, or other basis functions, is bound to run into the curse of dimensionality problem. In recent years a new class of techniques, the deep neu-ral network model, has shown remarkable success in artificial intelligence (e.g., refs. 2-6). The neural network is an old idea but recent experience has shown that deep networks with many layers seem to do a surprisingly good job in modeling complicated datasets. In terms of representing functions, the neural network model is compositional: It uses compositions of simple functions to approximate complicated ones. In contrast , the approach of classical approximation theory is usually additive. Mathematically, there are universal approximation theorems stating that a single hidden-layer neural network can approximate a wide class of functions on compact subsets (see, e.g., survey in ref. 7 and the references therein), even though we still lack a theoretical framework for explaining the seemingly unreasonable effectiveness of multilayer neural networks, which are widely used nowadays. Despite this, the practical success of deep neural networks in artificial intelligence has been very astonishing and encourages applications to other problems where the curse of dimensionality has been a tormenting issue. In this paper, we extend the power of deep neural networks to another dimension by developing a strategy for solving a large class of high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs using deep learning. The class of PDEs that we deal with is (nonlinear) parabolic PDEs. Special cases include the Black-Scholes equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. To do so, we make use of the reformulation of these PDEs as backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) (e.g., refs. 8 and 9) and approximate the gradient of the solution using deep neural networks. The methodology bears some resemblance to deep reinforcement learning with the BSDE playing the role of model-based reinforcement learning (or control theory models) and the gradient of the solution playing the role of policy function. Numerical Significance Partial differential equations (PDEs) are among the most ubiquitous tools used in modeling problems in nature. However, solving high-dimensional PDEs has been notoriously difficult due to the "curse of dimensionality." This paper introduces a practical algorithm for solving nonlinear PDEs in very high (hundreds and potentially thousands of) dimensions. Numerical results suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective for a wide variety of problems, in terms of both accuracy and speed. We believe that this opens up a host of possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their interrelationships.},

Interestingly, during the asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, the RNA-binding proteins MEX-5 and PIE-1 form opposing concentration gradients in the absence of a local source. In this study, we use near-total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging and single-particle tracking to characterize the reaction/diffusion dynamics that maintain the MEX-5 and PIE-1 gradients. Our findings suggest that both proteins interconvert between fast-diffusing and slow-diffusing states on timescales that are much shorter (seconds) than the timescale of gradient formation (minutes). The kinetics of diffusion-state switching are strongly polarized along the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis by the PAR polarity system such that fast-diffusing MEX-5 and PIE-1 particles are approximately symmetrically distributed, whereas slow-diffusing particles are highly enriched in the anterior and posterior cytoplasm, respectively. Using mathematical modeling, we show that local differences in the kinetics of diffusion-state switching can rapidly generate stable concentration gradients over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales.},

Here, we quantified cell–cell tension and cell–ECM traction throughout the complete cycle of a large cell population in a growing epithelium. These measurements unveil temporal mechanical patterns that span the entire cell cycle and regulate its duration, the G1–S transition and mitotic rounding. Cells subjected to higher intercellular tension exhibit a higher probability to transition from G1 to S, as well as shorter G1 and S–G2–M phases. Moreover, we show that tension and mechanical energy are better predictors of the duration of G1 than measured geometric properties. Tension increases during the cell cycle but decreases 3 hours before mitosis. Using optogenetic control of contractility, we show that this tension drop favours mitotic rounding. Our results establish that cell cycle progression is regulated cooperatively by forces between the dividing cell and its neighbours.},

In contrast, in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, not all ECT-2-dependent functions require CYK-4. In this study, we identify a novel protein, NOP-1, that functions in parallel with CYK-4 to promote RhoA activation. We use mutations in nop-1 and cyk-4 to dissect cytokinesis and cell polarization.

This co-occurrence suggests that protein clusters might possess intrinsic properties that make them a useful substrate for spatial regulation. Here, we demonstrate that protein droplets show a robust form of spatial memory, maintaining the spatial pattern of an inhibitor of droplet formation long after it has been removed. Despite this persistence, droplets can be highly dynamic, continuously exchanging monomers with the diffuse phase. We investigate the principles of biophysical spatial memory in three contexts: a computational model of phase separation; a novel optogenetic system where light can drive rapid, localized dissociation of liquid-like protein droplets; and membrane-localized signal transduction from clusters of receptor tyrosine kinases. Our results suggest that the persistent polarization underlying many cellular and developmental processes could arise through a simple biophysical process, without any additional biochemical feedback loops. Dine et al. use mathematical modeling and cellular optogenetics to determine that phase-separated protein clusters act as a long-lived “memory foam” that can retain spatial patterns in cells.},

abstract = {Rho GTPases are regulatory proteins whose patterns on the surface of a cell affect cell polarization, cell motility and repair of single-cell wounds. The stereotypical patterns formed by two such proteins, Rho and Cdc42, around laser-injured frog oocytes permit experimental analysis of GTPase activation, inactivation, segregation and crosstalk. Here, we review the development and analysis of a spatial model of GTPase dynamics that describe the formation of concentric zones of Rho and Cdc42 activity around wounds, and describe how this model has provided insights into the roles of the GTPase effector molecules protein kinase C (PKC$\beta$ and PKC$\eta$) and guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) in the wound response. We further demonstrate how the use of a 'sharp switch' model approximation in combination with bifurcation analysis can aid mapping the model behaviour in parameter space (approximate results confirmed with numerical simulation methods). Using these methods in combination with experimental manipulation of PKC activity (PKC overexpression (OE) and dominant negative conditions), we have shown that: (i) PKC$\beta$ most probably acts by enhancing existing positive feedbacks (from Rho to itself via the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor domain of Abr, and from Cdc42 to itself), (ii) PKC$\eta$ most probably increases basal rates of inactivation (or possibly decreases basal rates of activation) of Rho and Cdc42, and (iii) the graded distribution of PKC$\eta$ and its effect on initial Rho activity accounts for inversion of zones in a fraction (20%) of PKC$\eta$ OE cells. Finally, we speculate that GDIs (which sequester GTPases) may have a critical role in defining the spatial domain, where the wound response may occur. This paper provides a more thorough exposition of the methods of analysis used in the investigation, whereas previous work on this topic was addressed to biologists and abbreviated such discussion.},

abstract = {Contractile rings play critical roles in a number of biological processes, including oogenesis, wound healing, and cytokinesis. In many cases, the activity of motor proteins such as nonmuscle myosins is required for appropriate constriction of these contractile rings. In the gonad of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, ring channels are a specialized form of con-tractile ring that are maintained at a constant diameter before oogenesis. We propose a model of ring channel maintenance that explicitly incorporates force generation by motor proteins that can act normally or tangentially to the ring channel opening. We find that both modes of force generation are needed to maintain the ring channels. We demonstrate experimentally that the type II myosins NMY-1 and NMY-2 antagonize each other in the ring channels by producing force in perpendicular directions: the experimental depletion of NMY-1/theoretical decrease in orthogonal force allows premature ring constriction and cellularization, whereas the experimental depletion of NMY-2/theoretical decrease in tangential force opens the ring channels and prevents cellularization. Together, our experimental and theoretical results show that both forces, mediated by NMY-1 and NMY-2, are crucial for maintaining the appropriate ring channel diameter and dynamics throughout the gonad.},

abstract = {At the one-cell stage, the C. elegans embryo becomes polarized along the anterior-posterior axis. The PAR proteins form complementary anterior and posterior domains in a dynamic process driven by cytoskeletal rearrangement. Initially, the PAR proteins are uniformly distributed throughout the embryo. After a cue from fertilization, cortical actomyosin contracts toward the anterior pole. PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 (the anterior PAR proteins) become restricted to the anterior cortex. PAR-1 and PAR-2 (the posterior PAR proteins) become enriched in the posterior cortical region. We present a mathematical model of this polarity establishment process, in which we take a novel approach to combine reaction-diffusion dynamics of the PAR proteins coupled to a simple model of actomyosin contraction. We show that known interactions between the PAR proteins are sufficient to explain many aspects of the observed cortical PAR dynamics in both wild-type and mutant embryos. However, cytoplasmic PAR protein polarity, which is vital for generating daughter cells with distinct molecular components, cannot be properly explained within such a framework. We therefore consider additional mechanisms that can reproduce the proper cytoplasmic polarity. In particular we predict that cytoskeletal asymmetry in the cytoplasm, in addition to the cortical actomyosin asymmetry, is a critical determinant of PAR protein localization. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

An opposing gradient of partitioning-defective protein kinases, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and PAR-1, at the cell cortex guides diverse asymmetries in the structure of metazoan cells, but the mechanism underlying their spatial patterning remains poorly understood. Here, we show in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes that the cortical PAR-1 gradient is patterned as a consequence of dual mechanisms: stabilization of cortical dynamics and protection from aPKC-mediated cortical exclusion. Dual control of cortical PAR-1 depends on a physical interaction with the PRBH-domain protein PAR-2. Using a reconstitution approach in heterologous cells, we demonstrate that PAR-1, PAR-2, and polarized Cdc42-PAR-6-aPKC comprise the minimal network sufficient for the establishment of an opposing cortical gradient. Our findings delineate the mechanism governing cortical polarity, in which a circuit consisting of aPKC and the PRBH-domain protein ensures the local recruitment of PAR-1 to a well-defined cortical compartment.},

Antagonistic interactions involving two conserved kinases, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and PAR-1, have been implicated in polarity maintenance, but the mechanisms that initiate the formation of asymmetric PAR domains are not understood. Here, we describe one pathway used by the sperm-donated centrosome to polarize the PAR proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes. Before polarization, cortical aPKC excludes PAR-1 kinase and its binding partner PAR-2 by phosphorylation. During symmetry breaking, microtubules nucleated by the centrosome locally protect PAR-2 from phosphorylation by aPKC, allowing PAR-2 and PAR-1 to access the cortex nearest the centrosome. Cortical PAR-1 phosphorylates PAR-3, causing the PAR-3-aPKC complex to leave the cortex. Our findings illustrate how microtubules, independently of actin dynamics, stimulate the self-organization of PAR proteins by providing local protection against a global barrier imposed by aPKC.},

In C. elegans, reciprocal translocations that lead to aneuploidy have been widely used to maintain lethal and sterile mutations in stable stocks. Here, we generated a set of aneuploidy-free and structurally defined crossover suppressors that contain two overlapping inversions using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The toolkit includes 13 crossover suppressors and covers approximately 63% of all C. elegans coding genes. Together with the classical intrachromosomal crossover suppressors, the system now covers 89% of the coding genes. We also labeled the created balancers with fluorescent and phenotypic markers. We show that the crossover suppressors are better for embryonic analysis compared with translocational balancers. Additionally, we demonstrate an efficient method to generate lethal alleles by targeting essential genes on a chromosome balanced with a crossover suppressor. The toolkit will allow more efficient experiments in which lethal and sterile mutants can be analyzed. Balancer chromosomes are critical tools for genetic research. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, Dejima et al. established a collection of balancer chromosomes in C. elegans.

MARCKS-GFP was rapidly translocated from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm after the treatment with phorbol ester, which translocates protein kinase C (PKC) to the plasma membrane. In contrast, PKC activation by hydrogen peroxide, which was not accompanied by PKC translocation, did not alter the intracellular localization of MARCKS-GFP. Non-myristoylated mutant of MARCKS-GFP was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, including the nucleoplasm, and was not translocated by phorbol ester or by hydrogen peroxide. Phosphorylation of wild-type MARCKS-GFP was observed in cells treated with phorbol ester but not with hydrogen peroxide, whereas non-myristoylated mutant of MARCKS-GFP was phosphorylated in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide but not with phorbol ester. Phosphorylation of both MARCKS-GFPs reduced the amount of F-actin. These findings revealed that PKC targeting to the plasma membrane is required for the phosphorylation of membrane-associated MARCKS and that a mutant MARCKS existing in the cytoplasm can be phosphorylated by PKC activated in the cytoplasm without translocation but not by PKC targeted to the membrane.},

We address asymmetric fate determinant localization in the developing Drosophila nervous system, specifically the control of the polarized distribution of the cell fate adapter protein Miranda. We reveal a step-wise polarization of Miranda in larval neuroblasts and find that Miranda's dynamics and cortical association are differently regulated between interphase and mitosis. In interphase, Miranda binds to the plasma membrane. Then, before nuclear envelope breakdown, Miranda is phosphorylated by aPKC and displaced into the cytoplasm. This clearance is necessary for the subsequent establishment of asymmetric Miranda localization. After nuclear envelope breakdown, actomyosin activity is required to maintain Miranda asymmetry. Therefore, phosphorylation by aPKC and differential binding to the actomyosin network are required at distinct phases of the cell cycle to polarize fate determinant localization in neuroblasts.},

abstract = {The position of the mitotic spindle determines the plane of cell cleavage, and thereby the location, size, and content of daughter cells. Spindle positioning is driven by dynein-mediated pulling forces exerted on astral microtubules. This process requires an evolutionarily conserved complex of $\alpha$-GDP, GPR-1,2/Pins/LGN, and LIN-5/Mud/NuMA proteins. It remains unknown whether this complex merely forms a membrane anchor for dynein, or whether the individual components have additional functions, for instance through G$\alpha$-GTP or dynein activation. To functionally dissect this system, we developed a genetic strategy for light-controlled localization of endogenous proteins in C. elegans embryos. Controlled germline expression and membrane recruitment of the G$\alpha$; regulators RIC-8/Ric-8A and RGS-7/Loco/RGS3, and replacement of G$\alpha$ with a light-inducible membrane anchor demonstrated that G$\alpha$-GTP signaling is dispensable for pulling force generation. In the absence of G$\alpha$, cortical recruitment of GPR-1,2 or LIN-5, but not dynein itself, induced high pulling forces. Local recruitment of LIN-5 overruled normal cell-cycle and polarity regulation, and provided experimental control over the spindle and cell cleavage plane. Our results define G$\alpha$-GDP-GPR-1,2/Pins/LGN as a regulatable membrane anchor, and LIN-5/Mud/NuMA as a potent activator of dynein-dependent spindle positioning forces. This study also highlights the possibilities for optogenetic control of endogenous proteins within an animal system.},

The emergence of patterns generated by interactions of diffusing proteins is a paradigmatic example for self-organization. In this article we review quantitative models for intracellular Min protein patterns in E. coli, Cdc42 polarization in S. cerevisiae, and the bipolar PAR protein patterns found in C. elegans. By analyzing the molecular processes driving these systems we derive a theoretical perspective on general principles underlying self-organized pattern formation. We argue that intracellular pattern formation is not captured by concepts such as "activators"', "inhibitors", or "substrate-depletion". Instead, intracellular pattern formation is based on the redistribution of proteins by cytosolic diffusion, and the cycling of proteins between distinct conformational states. Therefore, mass-conserving reaction-diffusion equations provide the most appropriate framework to study intracellular pattern formation. We conclude that directed transport, e.g. cytosolic diffusion along an actively maintained cytosolic gradient, is the key process underlying pattern formation. Thus the basic principle of self-organization is the establishment and maintenance of directed transport by intracellular protein dynamics.},

abstract = {Self-organization refers to the emergence of an overall order in time and space of a given system that results from the collective interactions of its individual components. This concept has been widely recognized as a core principle in pattern formation for multi-component systems of the physical, chemical and biological world. It can be distinguished from self-assembly by the constant input of energy required to maintain order—and self-organization therefore typically occurs in non-equilibrium or dissipative systems. Cells, with their constant energy consumption and myriads of local interactions between distinct proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids, represent the perfect playground for self-organization. It therefore comes as no surprise that many properties and features of self-organized systems, such as spontaneous formation of patterns, nonlinear coupling of reactions, bi-stable switches, waves and oscillations, are found in all aspects of modern cell biology. Ultimately, self-organization lies at the heart of the robustness and adaptability found in cellular and organismal organization, and hence constitutes a fundamental basis for natural selection and evolution.

abstract = {The Escherichia coli Min system self-organizes into a cell-pole to cell-pole oscillator on the membrane to prevent divisions at the cell poles. Reconstituting the Min system on a lipid bilayer has contributed to elucidating the oscillatory mechanism. However, previous in vitro patterns were attained with protein densities on the bilayer far in excess of those in vivo and failed to recapitulate the standing wave oscillations observed in vivo. Here we studied Min protein patterning at limiting MinD concentrations reflecting the in vivo conditions. We identified "burst" patterns-radially expanding and imploding binding zones of MinD, accompanied by a peripheral ring of MinE. Bursts share several features with the in vivo dynamics of the Min system including standing wave oscillations. Our data support a patterning mechanism whereby the MinD-to-MinE ratio on the membrane acts as a toggle switch: recruiting and stabilizing MinD on the membrane when the ratio is high and releasing MinD from the membrane when the ratio is low. Coupling this toggle switch behavior with MinD depletion from the cytoplasm drives a self-organized standing wave oscillator.},

abstract = {Protein patterns are known to adapt to cell shape and serve as spatial templates that choreograph downstream processes like cell polarity or cell division. However, how can pattern-forming proteins sense and respond to the geometry of a cell, and what mechanistic principles underlie pattern formation? Current models invoke mechanisms based on dynamic instabilities arising from nonlinear interactions between proteins but neglect the influence of the spatial geometry itself. Here, we show that patterns can emerge as a direct result of adaptation to cell geometry, in the absence of dynamical instability. We present a generic reaction module that allows protein densities robustly to adapt to the symmetry of the spatial geometry. The key component is an NTPase protein that cycles between nucleotide-dependent membrane-bound and cytosolic states. For elongated cells, we find that the protein dynamics generically leads to a bipolar pattern, which vanishes as the geometry becomes spherically symmetrical. We show that such a reaction module facilitates universal adaptation to cell geometry by sensing the local ratio of membrane area to cytosolic volume. This sensing mechanism is controlled by the membrane affinities of the different states. We apply the theory to explain AtMinD bipolar patterns in $\Delta$$\Delta$<mml:math><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">$\Delta$</mml:mi></mml:math> EcMinDE Escherichia coli. Due to its generic nature, the mechanism could also serve as a hitherto-unrecognized spatial template in many other bacterial systems. Moreover, the robustness of the mechanism enables self-organized optimization of protein patterns by evolutionary processes. Finally, the proposed module can be used to establish geometry-sensitive protein gradients in synthetic biological systems.},

The spatiotemporal organization of cells and organisms, however, also depends on physical processes such as diffusion or cytoplasmic flows, and strategies to perturb physical transport inside cells are not yet available. Here, we demonstrate focused-light-induced cytoplasmic streaming (FLUCS). FLUCS is local, directional, dynamic, probe-free, physiological, and is even applicable through rigid egg shells or cell walls. We explain FLUCS via time-dependent modelling of thermoviscous flows. Using FLUCS, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic flows drive partitioning-defective protein (PAR) polarization in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, and that cortical flows are sufficient to transport PAR domains and invert PAR polarity. In addition, we find that asymmetric cell division is a binary decision based on gradually varying PAR polarization states. Furthermore, the use of FLUCS for active microrheology revealed a metabolically induced fluid-to-solid transition of the yeast cytoplasm. Our findings establish how a wide range of transport-dependent models of cellular organization become testable by FLUCS.},

abstract = {Protein concentration gradients encode spatial information across cells and tissues and often depend on spatially localized protein synthesis. Here, we report that a different mechanism underlies the MEX-5 gradient. MEX-5 is an RNA-binding protein that becomes distributed in a cytoplasmic gradient along the anterior-to-posterior axis of the one-cell C. elegans embryo. We demonstrate that the MEX-5 gradient is a direct consequence of an underlying gradient in MEX-5 diffusivity. The MEX-5 diffusion gradient arises when the PAR-1 kinase stimulates the release of MEX-5 from slow-diffusive, RNA-containing complexes in the posterior cytoplasm. PAR-1 directly phosphorylates MEX-5 and is antagonized by the spatially uniform phosphatase PP2A. Mathematical modeling and in vivo observations demonstrate that spatially segregated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions are sufficient to generate stable protein concentration gradients in the cytoplasm. The principles demonstrated here apply to any spatially segregated modification cycle that affects protein diffusion and do not require protein synthesis or degradation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {S phase and mitotic onset are brought about by the action of multiple different cyclin-CDK complexes. However, it has been suggested that changes in the total level of CDK kinase activity, rather than substrate specificity, drive the temporal ordering of S phase and mitosis. Here, we present a phosphoproteomics-based systems analysis of CDK substrates in fission yeast and demonstrate that the phosphorylation of different CDK substrates can be temporally ordered during the cell cycle by a single cyclin-CDK. This is achieved by rising CDK activity and the differential sensitivity of substrates to CDK activity over a wide dynamic range. This is combined with rapid phosphorylation turnover to generate clearly resolved substrate-specific activity thresholds, which in turn ensures the appropriate ordering of downstream cell-cycle events. Comparative analysis with wild-type cells expressing multiple cyclin-CDK complexes reveals how cyclin-substrate specificity works alongside activity thresholds to fine-tune the patterns of substrate phosphorylation.},

@article{Hoege2010,
abstract = {Many metazoan cell types are polarized by asymmetric partitioning of the conserved PAR (PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3) complex [1–5]. Cortical domains containing this PAR complex are counterbalanced by opposing domains of varying composition [6–10]. The tumor-suppressor protein LGL [11, 12] facilitates asymmetric localization of cell fate determinants, in part through modulating the activity of the PAR complex [13, 14]. However, the mechanisms by which LGL acts to maintain a cortical domain remain unclear. Here we identify Caenorhabditis elegans LGL in a biochemical complex with PAR proteins, which localize to the anterior cortex. But LGL itself localizes to the posterior cortex. We show that increasing the amounts of LGL can restrict localization of the PAR complex to an anterior cortical domain, even in the absence of PAR-2. Importantly, LGL must be phosphorylated on conserved residues to exert this function. LGL and the PAR complex can maintain two cortical domains that are sufficient to partition cell fate determinants. Our data suggest a mechanism of “mutual elimination” in which an LGL phosphorylation cycle regulates association of the PAR complex with the cortex: binding of LGL to the PAR complex at the interface of the two domains stimulates its phosphorylation by PKC-3, and the whole complex leaves the cortex.},

Although many factors required for the establishment of A/P polarity have been described, the nature of the spatial cue provided by the sperm remains unknown. Here we show that a microtubule-organizing centre is necessary and sufficient to establish several aspects of A/P polarity. In wildtype embryos, appearance of the first molecular asymmetries along the A/P axis correlates with and requires nucleation of microtubules by the sperm-derived centrosomes (sperm asters). In mutant embryos arrested in meiosis, sperm asters fail to form, and posterior is defined by the position of the persistent meiotic spindle rather than by the position of the sperm. Together, our data indicate that the primary spatial cue for A/P polarity in C. elegans derives from microtubules emanating from the sperm asters. Our findings support a parallel between C. elegans zygotes and other cells, such as Drosophila oocytes, which rely on microtubules to regulate polarity.},

abstract = {The C. elegans PAR proteins PAR-3, PAR-6, and PKC-3 are asymmetrically localized and have essential roles in cell polarity. We show that the one-cell C. elegans embryo contains a dynamic and contractile actomyosin network that appears to be destabilized near the point of sperm entry. This asymmetry initiates a flow of cortical nonmuscle myosin (NMY-2) and F-actin toward the opposite, future anterior, pole. PAR-3, PAR-6, and PKC-3, as well as non-PAR proteins that associate with the cytoskeleton, appear to be transported to the anterior by this cortical flow. In turn, PAR-3, PAR-6, and PKC-3 modulate cortical actomyosin dynamics and promote cortical flow. PAR-2, which localizes to the posterior cortex, inhibits NMY-2 from accumulating at the posterior cortex during flow, thus maintaining asymmetry by preventing inappropriate, posterior-directed flows. Similar actomyosin flows accompany the establishment of PAR asymmetries that form after the one-cell stage, suggesting that actomyosin-mediated cortical flows have a general role in PAR asymmetry.

Here, we have dissected the role of the three aPKC phosphorylation sites within the tumor suppressor Lethal giant larvae. Using a cultured Drosophila S2 cell cortical displacement assay, we observed that phosphorylation at any one site causes only partial displacement. Complete displacement requires that all three sites be modified. We undertook a kinetic analysis to determine if aPKC phosphorylates each site equivalently. As the sites are closely spaced, we observed not only differences in the rate of phosphorylation but also interaction between the sites. A complete description of the rates reveals a preferential order of phosphorylation.

abstract = {Polarity is a fundamental cellular feature that is critical for generating cell diversity and maintaining organ functions during development. In C. elegans, the one-cell embryo is polarized via asymmetric localization of the PAR proteins, which in turn are required to establish the future anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. PAR-3, a conserved PDZ domain-containing protein, acts with PAR-6 and PKC-3 (atypical protein kinase; aPKC) to regulate cell polarity and junction formation in a variety of cell types. To understand how PAR-3 localizes and functions during C. elegans development, we produced targeted mutations and deletions of conserved domains of PAR-3 and examined the localization and function of the GFP-tagged proteins in C. elegans embryos and larvae. We find that CR1, the PAR-3 self-oligomerization domain, is required for PAR-3 cortical distribution and function only during early embryogenesis and that PDZ2 is required for PAR-3 to accumulate stably at the cell periphery in early embryos and at the apical surface in pharyngeal and intestinal epithelial cells. We also show that phosphorylation at S863 by PKC-3 is not essential in early embryogenesis, but is important in later development. Surprisingly neither PDZ1 nor PDZ3 are essential for localization or function. Our results indicate that the different domains and phosphorylated forms of PAR-3 can have different roles during C. elegans development. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Four mutations in par-1 and par-4 are fully expressed maternal effect lethal mutations; all embryos from mothers homozygous for these mutations arrest as amorphous masses of differentiated cells but are specifically lacking intestinal cells. Four mutations in par-2, par-3, and par-4 are incompletely expressed maternal effect lethal mutations and are also grandchildless; some embryos from homozygous mothers survive and grow to become infertile adults due to absence of functional germ cells. We propose that all of these defects result from the failure of a maternally encoded system for intracellular localization in early embryos.},

abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the reaction-rate equations); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the master equation). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this stochastic simulation algorithm correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

Here we report an efficient induction of RNAi using bacteria to deliver double-stranded RNA. This method makes use of bacteria that are deficient in RNaseIII, an enzyme that normally degrades a majority of dsRNAs in the bacterial cell. Bacteria deficient for RNaseIII were engineered to produce high quantities of specific dsRNA segments. When fed to C. elegans, such engineered bacteria were found to produce populations of RNAi-affected animals with phenotypes that were comparable in expressivity to the corresponding loss-of-function mutants. We found the method to be most effective in inducing RNAi for non-neuronal tissue of late larval and adult hermaphrodites, with decreased effectiveness in the nervous system, in early larval stages, and in males. Bacteria-induced RNAi phenotypes could be maintained over the course of several generations with continuous feeding, allowing for convenient assessments of the biological consequences of specific genetic interference and of continuous exposure to dsRNAs. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Asymmetric localization of PAR proteins is a hallmark of polarized cells, but the mechanisms that create PAR asymmetry are not well understood. In the C. elegans zygote, PAR asymmetry is initiated by a transient actomyosin contraction, which sweeps the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 complex toward the anterior pole of the egg. The RING finger protein PAR-2 accumulates in a complementary pattern in the posterior cortex. Here we present evidence that PAR-2 participates in a feedback loop to stabilize polarity. PAR-2 is a target of the PKC-3 kinase and is excluded from the anterior cortex by PKC-3-dependent phosphorylation. The RING domain of PAR-2 is required to overcome inhibition by PKC-3 and stabilize PAR-2 on the posterior cortex. Cortical PAR-2 in turn prevents PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC-3 from returning to the posterior, in a PAR-1- and PAR-5-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that reciprocal inhibitory interactions among PAR proteins stabilize polarity by reinforcing an initial asymmetry in PKC-3. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Polarization of cells by PAR proteins requires the segregation of antagonistic sets of proteins into two mutually exclusive membrane-associated domains. Understanding how nanometer scale interactions between individual PAR proteins allow spatial organization across cellular length scales requires determining the kinetic properties of PAR proteins and how they are modified in space. We find that PAR-2 and PAR-6, which localize to opposing PAR domains, undergo exchange between well mixed cytoplasmic populations and laterally diffusing membrane-associated states. Domain maintenance does not involve diffusion barriers, lateral sorting, or active transport. Rather, both PAR proteins are free to diffuse between domains, giving rise to a continuous boundary flux because of lateral diffusion of molecules down the concentration gradients that exist across the embryo. Our results suggest that the equalizing effects of lateral diffusion are countered by actin-independent differences in the effective membrane affinities of PAR proteins between the two domains, which likely depend on the ability of each PAR species to locally modulate the membrane affinity of opposing PAR species within its domain. We propose that the stably polarized embryo reflects a dynamic steady state in which molecules undergo continuous diffusion between regions of net association and dissociation.},

In the single-cell embryo of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the segregation of Par proteins is crucial for proper division and cell fate specification. Actomyosin-based cortical flows drive the initial formation of anterior and posterior Par domains, but cortical actin is not required for the maintenance of these domains. Here we develop a model of interactions between the Par proteins that includes both mutual inhibition and PAR-3 oligomerization. We show that this model gives rise to a bistable switch mechanism, allowing the Par proteins to occupy distinct anterior and posterior domains seen in the early C. elegans embryo, independent of dynamics or asymmetries in the actin cortex. The model predicts a sharp loss of cortical Par protein asymmetries during gradual depletion of the Par protein PAR-6, and we confirm this prediction experimentally. Together, these results suggest both mutual inhibition and PAR-3 oligomerization are sufficient to maintain distinct Par protein domains in the early C. elegans embryo. {\textcopyright} 2011 Biophysical Society.},

In this review, we focus on how ultrasensitive components can be important for the functioning of more complex signaling circuits. Ultrasensitivity can allow the effective transmission of signals down a signaling cascade, can contribute to the generation of bistability by positive feedback, and can promote the production of biochemical oscillations in negative feedback loops. This makes ultrasensitivity a key building block in systems biology and synthetic biology.},

Here, we take a synthetic biology approach to investigate the design principles governing cell polarization. First, using a coarse-grained computational model, we searched for all possible simple networks that can achieve polarization. All solutions contained one of three minimal motifs: positive feedback, mutual inhibition, or inhibitor with positive feedback. These minimal motifs alone could achieve polarization under limited conditions; circuits that combined two or more of these motifs were significantly more robust. With these design principles as a blueprint, we experimentally constructed artificial polarization networks in yeast, using a toolkit of chimeric signaling proteins that spatially direct the synthesis and degradation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). Circuits with combinatorial motifs yielded clear foci of synthetic PIP3that can persist for nearly an hour. Thus, by harnessing localization-regulated signaling molecules, we can engineer simple molecular circuits that reliably execute spatial self-organized programs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {To become polarized, cells must first 'break symmetry'. Symmetry breaking is the process by which an unpolarized, symmetric cell develops a singularity, often at the cell periphery, that is used to develop a polarity axis. The Caenorhabditis elegans zygote breaks symmetry under the influence of the sperm-donated centrosome, which causes the PAR polarity regulators to sort into distinct anterior and posterior cortical domains. Modelling analyses have shown that cortical flows induced by the centrosome combined with antagonism between anterior and posterior PARs (mutual exclusion) are sufficient, in principle, to break symmetry, provided that anterior and posterior PAR activities are precisely balanced. Experimental evidence indicates, however, that the system is surprisingly robust to changes in cortical flows, mutual exclusion and PAR balance. We suggest that this robustness derives from redundant symmetry-breaking inputs that engage two positive feedback loops mediated by the anterior and posterior PAR proteins. In particular, the PAR-2 feedback loop stabilizes the polarized state by creating a domain where posterior PARs are immune to exclusion by anterior PARs. The two feedback loops in the PAR network share characteristics with the two feedback loops in the Cdc42 polarization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

We hypothesize that decoding occurs by modulation of signaling through changes in plasma membrane curvature. Using analytical approaches and numerical simulations, we studied how elongation of cell shape affects plasma membrane signaling. Mathematical analyses reveal transient accumulation of activated receptors at regions of higher curvature with increasing cell eccentricity. This distribution of activated receptors is periodic, following the Mathieu function, and it arises from local imbalance between reaction and diffusion of soluble ligands and receptors in the plane of the membrane. Numerical simulations show that transient microdomains of activated receptors amplify signals to downstream protein kinases. For growth factor receptor pathways, increasing cell eccentricity elevates the levels of activated cytoplasmic Src and nuclear MAPK1,2. These predictions were experimentally validated by changing cellular eccentricity, showing that shape is a locus of retrievable information storage in cells. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The contractile response is variable and depends on actomyosin network architecture and biochemical composition. To determine how this coupling regulates actomyosin-driven contraction, we used a micropatterning method that enables the spatial control of actin assembly. We generated a variety of actin templates and measured how defined actin structures respond to myosin-induced forces. We found that the same actin filament crosslinkers either enhance or inhibit the contractility of a network, depending on the organization of actin within the network. Numerical simulations unified the roles of actin filament branching and crosslinking during actomyosin contraction. Specifically, we introduce the concept of "network connectivity" and show that the contractions of distinct actin architectures are described by the same master curve when considering their degree of connectivity. This makes it possible to predict the dynamic response of defined actin structures to transient changes in connectivity. We propose that, depending on the connectivity and the architecture, network contraction is dominated by either sarcomeric-like or buckling mechanisms. More generally, this study reveals how actin network contractility depends on its architecture under a defined set of biochemical conditions.},

However, the spatial regulation mechanism of LGL membrane localization has remained unclear. For systematic elucidation, we set out to reconstitute a minimal polarity unit using a model membrane, Caenorhabditis elegans LGL (LGL-1), and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) supposed to activate the membrane switch. We identified a membrane binding sequence (MBS) in LGL-1 by a screen in vivo, reconstituted LGL-1 membrane binding in vitro, and successfully implemented the membrane switch by aPKC phosphorylation activity, detaching LGL from membranes. Upon membrane binding, LGL-1 MBS folds into an alpha-helix in which three regions can be identified: a positively charged patch, a switch area containing the three aPKC phosphorylation sites, and a hydrophobic area probably buried in the membrane. Phosphorylation by aPKC dramatically reduces the binding affinity of the LGL-1 MBS to negatively charged model membranes, inducing its detachment. Specific residues in the MBS are critical for LGL-1 function in C. elegans.},

abstract = {Epithelial tissues are composed of polarized cells with distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains [1]. In the Drosophila ovarian follicle cell epithelium, apical membranes are specified by Crumbs (Crb), Stardust (Sdt), and the aPKC-Par6-cdc42 complex [1-7]. Basolateral membranes are specified by Lethal giant larvae (Lgl), Discs large (Dlg), and Scribble (Scrib) [8, 9]. Apical and basolateral determinants are known to act in a mutually antagonistic fashion, but it remains unclear how this interaction generates polarity [1]. We have built a computer model of apicobasal polarity that suggests that the combination of positive feedback among apical determinants plus mutual antagonism between apical and basal determinants is essential for polarization. In agreement with this model, in vivo experiments define a positive feedback loop in which Crb self-recruits via Crb-Crb extracellular domain interactions, recruitment of Sdt-aPKC-Par6-cdc42, aPKC phosphorylation of Crb, and recruitment of Expanded (Ex) and Kibra (Kib) to prevent endocytic removal of Crb from the plasma membrane. Lgl antagonizes the operation of this feedback loop, explaining why apical determinants do not normally spread into the basolateral domain. Once Crb is removed from the plasma membrane, it undergoes recycling via Rab11 endosomes. Our results provide a dynamic model for understanding how epithelial polarity is maintained in Drosophila follicle cells. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

@article{Mori2008,
abstract = {Motile eukaryotic cells polarize in response to external signals. Numerous mechanisms have been suggested to account for this symmetry breaking and for the ensuing robust polarization. Implicated in this process are various proteins that are recruited to the plasma membrane and segregate at an emergent front or back of the polarizing cell. Among these are PI3K, PTEN, and members of the Rho family GTPases such as Cdc42, Rac, and Rho. Many such proteins, including the Rho GTPases, cycle between active membrane-bound forms and inactive cytosolic forms. In previous work, we have shown that this property, together with appropriate crosstalk, endows a biochemical circuit (Cdc42, Rac, and Rho) with the property of inherent polarizability. Here we show that this property is present in an even simpler system comprised of a single active/inactive protein pair with positive feedback to its own activation. The simplicity of this minimal system also allows us to explain the mechanism using insights from mathematical analysis. The basic idea resides in a well-known property of reaction-diffusion systems with bistable kinetics, namely, propagation of fronts. However, it crucially depends on exchange between active and inactive forms of the chemicals with unequal rates of diffusion, and overall conservation to pin the waves into a stable polar distribution. We refer to these dynamics as wave-pinning and we show that this phenomenon is distinct from Turing-instability-generated pattern formation that occurs in reaction-diffusion systems that appear to be very similar. We explain the mathematical basis of the phenomenon, relate it to spatial segregation of Rho GTPases, and show how it can account for spatial amplification and maintenance of polarity, as well as sensitivity to new stimuli typical in polarization of eukaryotic cells. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {We have developed computational techniques that allow image averaging to be applied to electron micrographs of filamentous molecules that exhibit tight and variable curvature. These techniques, which involve straightening by cubic-spline interpolation, image classification, and statistical analysis of the molecules' curvature properties, have been applied to purified brain clathrin. This trimeric filamentous protein polymerizes, both in vivo and in vitro, into a wide range of polyhedral structures. Contrasted by low-angle rotary shadowing, dissociated clathrin molecules appear as distinctive three-legged structures, called "triskelions" (E. Ungewickell and D. Branton (1981) Nature 289, 420). We find triskelion legs to vary from 35 to 62 nm in total length, according to an approximately bell-shaped distribution (?? = 51.6 nm). Peaks in averaged curvature profiles mark hinges or sites of enhanced flexibility. Such profiles, calculated for each length class, show that triskelion legs are flexible over their entire lengths. However, three curvature peaks are observed in every case: their locations define a proximal segment of systematically increasing length (14.0-19.0 nm), a mid-segment of fixed length (???12 nm), and a rather variable end-segment (11.6-19.5 nm), terminating in a hinge just before the globular terminal domain (???7.3 nm diameter). Thus, two major factors contribute to the overall variability in leg length: (1) stretching of the proximal segment and (2) stretching of the end-segment and/or scrolling of the terminal domain. The observed elasticity of the proximal segment may reflect phosphorylation of the clathrin light chains. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Reaction-diffusion systems have been widely successful in the theoretical description of biological patterning phenomena, giving rise to numerous models based on differing mechanisms, mathematical implementations and parameter choices. However, even for models with common design features, the diversity of mathematical realizations may hinder the identification of common behavior. Here, we analyze three different reaction-diffusion models for cell polarity that feature conservation of mass, rapid cytoplasmic diffusion and bistability via a cusp bifurcation of uniform states. In all three models, the nonuniform polar states are front solutions, and growth of domains ceases through stalling of a propagating front. For these three models we find a characteristic parameter space topology, comprising a region of linear instability that loops around the cusp point and that is enclosed by a 'comet-shaped' region of nonuniform domain states. We propose a minimal model based on the cusp bifurcation normal form that includes essential characteristics of all cell polarity models considered. For this minimal model, we provide a complete analytical description of the parameter space topology, and find that the instability loop appears as a generic property of the cusp bifurcation. This topological analysis provides a unifying understanding of earlier mathematically distinct models and is suitable to classify future models.},

We present evidence that PAR polarity arises from coupling of advective transport by the flowing cell cortex to a multistable PAR reaction-diffusion system. By inducing transient PAR segregation, advection serves as a mechanical trigger for the formation of a PAR pattern within an otherwise stably unpolarized system.

This primer introduces the organism and the many features that make it an outstanding experimental system, including its small size, rapid life cycle, transparency, and well-annotated genome. We survey the basic anatomical features, common technical approaches, and important discoveries in C. elegans research. Key to studying C. elegans has been the ability to address biological problems genetically, using both forward and reverse genetics, both at the level of the entire organism and at the level of the single, identified cell. These possibilities make C. elegans useful not only in research laboratories, but also in the classroom where it can be used to excite students who actually can see what is happening inside live cells and tissues.},

To functionally polarize cells, these proteins must activate aPKC within a spatially defined membrane domain on one side of the cell in response to symmetry-breaking cues. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote as a model, we find that the localization and activation of aPKC involve distinct, specialized aPKC-containing assemblies: a PAR-3-dependent assembly that responds to polarity cues and promotes efficient segregation of aPKC toward the anterior but holds aPKC in an inactive state, and a CDC-42-dependent assembly in which aPKC is active but poorly segregated. Cycling of aPKC between these distinct functional assemblies, which appears to depend on aPKC activity, effectively links cue-sensing and effector roles within the PAR network to ensure robust establishment of polarity.},

abstract = {Polarization of early embryos along cell contact patterns--referred to in this paper as radial polarization--provides a foundation for the initial cell fate decisions and morphogenetic movements of embryogenesis. Although polarity can be established through distinct upstream mechanisms in Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus laevis, and mouse embryos, in each species, it results in the restriction of PAR polarity proteins to contact-free surfaces of blastomeres. In turn, PAR proteins influence cell fates by affecting signaling pathways, such as Hippo and Wnt, and regulate morphogenetic movements by directing cytoskeletal asymmetries.},

@article{Zihni2017,
abstract = {Polarized epithelia develop distinct cell surface domains, with the apical membrane acquiring characteristic morphological features such as microvilli. Cell polarization is driven by polarity determinants including the evolutionarily conserved partitioning-defective (PAR) proteins that are separated into distinct cortical domains. PAR protein segregation is thought to be a consequence of asymmetric actomyosin contractions. The mechanism of activation of apically polarized actomyosin contractility is unknown. Here we show that the Cdc42 effector MRCK activates myosin-II at the apical pole to segregate aPKC–Par6 from junctional Par3, defining the apical domain. Apically polarized MRCK-activated actomyosin contractility is reinforced by cooperation with aPKC–Par6 downregulating antagonistic RhoA-driven junctional actomyosin contractility, and drives polarization of cytosolic brush border determinants and apical morphogenesis. MRCK-activated polarized actomyosin contractility is required for apical differentiation and morphogenesis in vertebrate epithelia and Drosophila photoreceptors. Our results identify an apical origin of actomyosin-driven morphogenesis that couples cytoskeletal reorganization to PAR polarity signalling.},

@article{Macara2013,
abstract = {Most human cancers arise either from epithelial cells or their progenitors. Epithelial cells possess a distinctive apical-basal polarity and loss of polarity is frequently assumed to be a common feature of cancer progression. In particular, cancer cell dissemination to ectopic sites, and metastatic growth at those sites, is often considered to require a mesenchymal transition in which the transformed epithelial cells lose their apical-basal polarity. However, many cancers retain epithelial characteristics, and until recently there has been little conclusive evidence for an involvement of the cell polarity machinery in tumour growth and metastasis. In this article, we discuss evidence that polarity proteins can be potent invasion suppressors but that loss of epithelial character is not essential either for tumour growth and invasion, or metastatic colonization.},

@article{Sailer2015,
abstract = {Dynamic maintenance of cell polarity is essential for development and physiology. Here we combine experiments and modeling to elucidate mechanisms that maintain cortical polarity in the C. elegans zygote. We show that polarity is dynamically stabilized by two coupled cross-inhibitory feedback loops: one involves the oligomeric scaffold PAR-3 and the kinase PAR-1, and the other involves CDC-42 and its putative GAP CHIN-1. PAR-3 and CDC-42 are both required locally to recruit PAR-6/PKC-3, which inhibits PAR-1 (shown previously) and inhibits local growth/accumulation of CHIN-1 clusters. Conversely, PAR-1 inhibits local accumulation of PAR-3 oligomers, while CHIN-1 inhibits CDC-42 (shown previously), such that either PAR-1 or CHIN-1 can prevent recruitment of PAR-6/PKC-3, but loss of both causes complete loss of polarity. Ultrasensitive dependence of CHIN-1 cluster growth on PAR-6/PKC-3 endows this core circuit with bistable dynamics, while transport of CHIN-1 clusters by cortical flow can stabilize the AP boundary against diffusive spread of PAR-6/PKC-3. Sailer et al. show that in the C. elegans zygote, polarity is maintained by two redundant cross-inhibitory loops, both involving dynamically clustered polarity proteins. Threshold dependence of cluster growth on opposing kinases stabilizes complementary cortical domains, while cortical transport of clustered proteins can stabilize boundary position against diffusive drift.},

@article{Robin2014,
abstract = {We describe a general, versatile and minimally invasive method to image single molecules near the cell surface that can be applied to any GFP-tagged protein in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We exploited tunable expression via RNAi and a dynamically exchanging monomer pool to achieve fast, continuous single-molecule imaging at optimal densities with signal-to-noise ratios adequate for robust single-particle tracking (SPT). We introduce a method called smPReSS, single-molecule photobleaching relaxation to steady state, that infers exchange rates from quantitative analysis of single-molecule photobleaching kinetics without using SPT. Combining SPT and smPReSS allowed for spatially and temporally resolved measurements of protein mobility and exchange kinetics. We used these methods to (i) resolve distinct mobility states and spatial variation in exchange rates of the polarity protein PAR-6 and (ii) measure spatiotemporal modulation of actin filament assembly and disassembly. These methods offer a promising avenue to investigate dynamic mechanisms that pattern the embryonic cell surface.},

abstract = {Regulated protein-protein interactions are critical for cell signaling, differentiation, and development. For the study of dynamic regulation of protein interactions in vivo, there is a need for techniques that can yield time-resolved information and probe multiple protein binding partners simultaneously, using small amounts of starting material. Here we describe a single-cell protein interaction assay. Single-cell lysates are generated at defined time points and analyzed using single-molecule pull-down, yielding information about dynamic protein complex regulation in vivo. We established the utility of this approach by studying PAR polarity proteins, which mediate polarization of many animal cell types. We uncovered striking regulation of PAR complex composition and stoichiometry during Caenorhabditis elegans zygote polarization, which takes place in less than 20 min. PAR complex dynamics are linked to the cell cycle by Polo-like kinase 1 and govern the movement of PAR proteins to establish polarity. Our results demonstrate an approach to study dynamic biochemical events in vivo.},
